**Consumer Protection Act \-** In this case, Farmers purchased groundnut seeds (TAG 37A) from M/s Shyam Beej Bhandar, alleged sub‑standard quality leading to crop failure, and obtained compensation orders from the District Forum, which were restored by the NCDRC after the State Commission had set them aside. The Supreme Court closely examined the joint Investigation/Inspection Report, noting that only about 50% of the pods were fully developed, that there was semi‑development in the remaining pods, and that excessive rainfall and other natural factors contributed significantly to yield shortfall, so there was not a “complete” deficiency of service by the producer and distributor. Holding that justice would be met by a balanced approach, the Court directed that only 50% of the compensation deposited pursuant to its interim order be released to the farmers (with interest) and the remaining 50% refunded to the appellants, while setting aside the findings fastening full deficiency of service on the appellants.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 438 \- Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 482**\- Granting the relief of anticipatory bail to an absconding accused person sets a bad precedent and sends a message that the law-abiding co-accused persons who stood trial, were wrong to diligently attend the process of trial and further, incentivises people to evade the process of law with impunity (Para 50\) \- An absconder is not entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail as a general rule, however, in certain exceptional cases, where on a perusal of the FIR, case diary and other relevant materials on record, the Court is of the prima facie opinion that no case is made out against the absconding accused, then the power of granting anticipatory bail may be exercised in favour of the absconding accused. (Para 44\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 439 \- Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 483- Bail \- Appeal \-** Post-bail conduct is never a valid consideration while dealing with an appeal against grant of bail, and such conduct is only relevant in an application for cancellation of bail.

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC)- Section 7 \- Essential Ingredients \-** The applicant must be a financial creditor; (b) there must be a financial debt; (c) there must be a default in respect of payment of financial debt owed not only to the applicant financial creditor but to any other financial creditor of the corporate debtor; and (d) the default must not be of a value lower than the threshold specified under Section 4 of IBC. (Para 28\) An application under Section 7 of a financial creditor for initiating CIRP of CD hinges on a default on part of CD of financial debt of an amount exceeding the specified threshold. The Form prescribed for making the application inter alia serves the purpose of bringing out the necessary ingredients for presentation of an application under Section 7(1) of IBC. The purpose of providing the date of default is to show that the debt is due and payable i.e., it has not become time barred. Therefore, in our view, if the application is substantially in conformity with the prescribed Form and discloses the necessary ingredients for making an application under sub-section (1) of Section 7 and provides the relevant materials/ information to substantiate those ingredients, the purpose of adhering to the Form is served, and such application is not liable to be rejected under clause (b) of sub-section (5) of Section 7 of IBC on the ground of any insignificant omission or error in the application. The aforesaid view finds support from use of the expression ‘may’ before ‘reject’ in Section 7(5)(b) of IBC. This means that if the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied from the materials placed before it in the application that all the necessary ingredients are satisfied for presentation of an application under Section 7(1) of IBC, it may not reject the application for an insignificant omission or non-adherence to the Form. (Para 40\)

**IBC \- Section 238A \- Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 18 \-** IBC does not exclude the application of Sections 6 or 14 or 18 of 1963 Act to proceedings under IBC, the same would be applicable to proceedings in NCLT/ NCLAT to the extent feasible. even if the default had occurred more than three years prior to the date of filing the application under Sections 7 or 9 of IBC, if there had been acknowledgment of debt within three years of filing the application, while the debt had not become barred by time, the application would be within limitation as the acknowledgment would extend the period of limitation under Section 18 of 1963 Act

**IBC \-** Initiation of proceedings by a financial creditor under other statutes does not bar filing of an application under the provisions of IBC. Moreover, mere pendency of a counterclaim for damages against a financial creditor will not operate as a bar on the right of the financial creditor to invoke the provisions of IBC \- Besides, mere allegations about commission of offences by officers of the financial creditor cannot stifle proceedings under IBC, particularly when those offences have no bearing on the existence of the financial debt. (Para 54-55)

**Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 18 \-** How a bank classifies its debt for managing its balance sheet is not a factor determining the starting point of limitation more so, when the debt is restructured and is acknowledged in fresh working capital consortium agreements entered for availing credit facilities. What is relevant is that by  irtue of execution of these working capital consortium agreements the banks got a fresh lease of life for their dues and based on those agreements, new NPA date(s) became relevant as starting point for computing limitation. A one-time settlement proposal of the debtor can constitute a valid acknowledgment.  An offer for one-time settlement of a live claim, made within the period of limitation, can be construed as an acknowledgment to attract Section 18 of 1963 Act. (Para 50-51)

**Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 18 \-** For the purposes of Section 18, the word ‘signed’ means signed either personally or by an agent duly authorized in this behalf. A director of a company can be considered its agent for the purposes of Section 18\. (Para 47\)

**Constitution of India \- Fraternity \- Sports \-**National, international, regional or even mohalla sports in India serve as the Karmabhumi where cohesion and collective purpose take tangible form. They bring together individuals from diverse social, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds under a common pursuit, embodying the Constitutional value of fraternity \- Accessibility of sports is important, for when opportunities to participate are open to all— irrespective of race, caste, religion, sex, or economic status—the unifying power of sport is amplified. This inclusiveness ensures that sports become not a privilege of the few but a medium through which fraternity is strengthened across society. In this way, sports operationalise what the framers envisioned: an intangible yet indispensable force that holds us together through shared effort and common purpose.  It is high time we recognize that sporting “facilities and opportunities” are “material resources of the community”, and their organizers are “the institutions of the national life”. As “places of public resort”, sporting institutions and bodies must remain accessible, not just for pursuing sport, but also for its administration. It should be the deeper Sadhana (endeavour) of the State, and it is also our Constitutional duty to ensure that sporting facilities and opportunities flourish with institutional efficiency, integrity, professionalism, and expertise. It is also necessary to ensure that sporting facilities and opportunities are not concentrated in the hands of the urban economic elite and that the revenues from sporting events, intellectual property and media rights are so distributed to subserve and encourage accessible and affordable sport in our country.

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016**\-IBC includes only those tangible or intangible assets within the insolvency framework over which the Corporate Debtor has ownership rights, including all rights and interests therein as recorded in the Balance Sheet (Para 62)- Spectrum allocated to telecom service providers (TSPs) and shown in their books of account as an “asset” cannot be subjected to proceedings under IBC. (Para 69\) Telegraph Act, Wireless Telegraphy Act and TRAI Act forms a complete and exhaustive code for all matters relating to telecom sector (Para 66\) The statutory regime under IBC cannot be permitted to make inroads into telecom sector and re-write and restructure the rights and liabilities arising out of administration, usage, and transfers of spectrum which operate under exclusive legal regime concerning telecommunications. (Para 67\)

**Interpretation of Statutes \-** Conflicts between a general statute and a special statute, or between two statutes each possessing a special character \- Principles: (I) Where two enactments are attracted to the same factual matrix, the initial inquiry must be directed towards determining whether either statute is general or special in relation to the subject-matter in issue. This determination is not made in the abstract, but by examining the dominant subject-matter of the statute, viewed through the prism of its legislative intent. An enactment may, depending on the context, operate as a general law for certain purposes and as a special law for others. The optimal outcome is achieved where each statute is allowed to function within its designated sphere, without trenching upon the field occupied by the other. Bearing this in mind, the provisions of both enactments must be scrutinised to assess whether they can be construed in a manner that permits harmonious construction. (II) Where it is evident that one enactment is intended to function as a special law governing a defined subject, while the other is a general law operating in a broader or overlapping domain, the established principle embodied in the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant applies. In such circumstances, the general provision must give way to the special provision. (III) In an eventuality where the contestation is between two special enactments, both having non-obstante clauses, the general rule is that later enactment must prevail over the earlier one. (IV) However, this is not an absolute rule. In the event of a conflict between two special acts, the dominant purpose of both statutes would have to be analyzed to ascertain which one should prevail over the other. The primary effort of the interpreter must be to harmonise, not excise. Hence, where both the enactments have the non obstante clause then in that case, the proper perspective would be that one has to see the subject and the dominant purpose for which the special enactment was made and in case the dominant purpose is covered by that contingencies, then notwithstanding that the Act might have come at a later point of time still the intention can be ascertained by looking to the objects and reasons. (Para 64\)

**Spectrum \-** Spectrum is vested and secured in the custody of the Central Government not as a property but as the exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining and operating telecommunication systems, and for granting licences. (Para 18\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 14 \-** While State largesse must be distributed in conformity with Article 14, ensuring fairness, transparency and adequate compensation to the public, it does not translate into transfer of ownership or creation of proprietary rights in favour of the licensee. . Spectrum access is in the nature of State largesse The grant of a telecom licence, including the right to use spectrum, does not effect a transfer of ownership or proprietary interest. What is conferred is a limited, conditional and revocable privilege to use spectrum for specified purposes and for a defined duration. (Para 33\)

**Interpretation of Statutes \-** Where a statutory provision is unconditionally omitted without a saving clause, all proceedings founded upon such provision must lapse. (Para 18\) \[**Context**: The appellants- accused were convicted under Section 3 read with Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act for allegedly possessing and intending to black‑market government‑quota cement originally meant for a public works contract. The Supreme Court held that, due to the Cement Control (Amendment) Order 1989 and the 1990 withdrawal of delegated powers, price and distribution control over cement and the State licensing regime had been decontrolled well before the alleged offence in 1994, leaving no operative control order under Section 3 whose contravention could sustain a conviction under Section 7\. While noting that diversion of government‑supplied cement might in a proper case attract offences under the Indian Penal Code, the Court set aside the conviction and sentence as legally untenable and allowed the appeals.\]

**Kerala Education Rules (KER)- Chapter XXXII, Rule 6(2) \-** When Rule 6.2(24)(iii) of Chapter XXXII of the Rules is read with the prospectus of the SET examination, particularly Clause 2 of the prospectus, it can be safely said that the candidate is required to pass SET in the concerned subject to qualify for the appointment to the post of HSST in the said concerned subject. Even though in Rule 6.2(24)(iii), the words “in the concerned subject” are missing, the said Rule cannot be interpreted in isolation and the textual omission has to be inferred from context, purpose and scheme of the provision. Thus, the said clause is required to be interpreted in the aforesaid manner. and possession of SET qualification in any other subject unrelated to the teaching post, does not suffice the statutory eligibility criteria.

**Transfer of Property Act 1882- Section 52 \-** The principle of lis pendens not excluded for money decrees. Transferee pendente lite is defined as someone to whom the property is transferred after the institution of the suit in which the decree was passed.  (Para 10\)

**Quote** \- .  We need a shift in mindset: the goal of the legal system should not just be to dispose of cases, but to ensure that the litigant enjoys the reliefs. The provisions in the CPC must be employed to secure actual relief, not just a formal decree. We must ensure that the legal process results in justice not just appearing to be done, but justice actually being done \- The true difficulties of a litigant begin only after they have obtained a decree. Winning a case is meaningless unless the winner actually gets the relief they sought.

**Pension \- Disability Pension \-Ex‑servicemen-** Pension is neither a bounty nor an ex gratia payment dependent upon the grace of the State. It is a deferred portion of compensation for past service and, upon fulfilment of the governing conditions, matures into a vested and enforceable right. Pensionary entitlements, therefore, partake the character of property, and cannot be withheld, reduced, or extinguished except by authority of law. This principle applies with full vigour to disability pension, which is grounded not merely in length of service, but in the impairment suffered by a member of the Armed Forces in the course of, or attributable to, the service rendered to the nation. The disability pension is not a matter of largesse, but a recognition of sacrifice made in service of the nation \- The right to receive disability pension is a valuable right and once found due, the benefit of the same has to be given from the date it became due. The same cannot be curtailed by restricting the benefit to a period of three years preceding the filing of the original application. (Para 15-20)

**Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 5 \-** Condonation of delay cannot be claimed as a matter of right. It is entirely the discretion of the Court whether or not to condone delay. (Para 21\) a distinction ought to be drawn between an ‘explanation’ and an ‘excuse’ that is proffered as cause for condonation of delay \-A different approach has to be adopted while this Court is considering an application for condonation of delay in presentation of an appeal/application and when it sits in appeal over a discretionary order of the high court granting the prayer for condonation of delay. In the case of the former, whether to condone or not would be the only question whereas in the latter, whether there has been proper exercise of discretion in favour of grant of the prayer for condonation has to be examined.

**Practice and Procedure \- Judgment \-** When several issues arise for being answered by a Court in the facts of a given case, ideally, disposal thereof ought to be preceded by recording the Court’s answers to each of such issues with reasons rather than the decision of the Court focusing on just one decisive point. This approach, apart from ensuring that all issues are considered providing clarity and assuring some sort of a finality, would respect the rights of the litigants to a comprehensive decision; also, if an appeal were carried from such decision, the appellate court would be benefitted by a reasoned decision of the original court.

(iii) The Court, in exercise of its power under Sections 437(5) or 439(2) of Cr.P.C. respectively, can direct for taking into custody the accused who has already been granted bail after cancellation of his bail. The Court in exercise of its power under Section 437(5) as well as Section 439(2) respectively can direct the person who has already been granted bail to be arrested and commit him to custody on addition of graver and non-cognizable offences which may not be necessary always with order of cancelling of earlier bail. (iv) In a case where an accused has already been granted bail, the investigating authority on addition of an offence or offences may not proceed to arrest the accused, but for arresting the accused on such addition of offence or offences it needs to obtain an order to arrest the accused from the Court which had granted the bail.

**Bail** \- The distinction between an appeal against an order granting bail and an application seeking cancellation of bail founded on postbail conduct or supervening circumstances. In an appeal against the grant of bail, the focus of judicial scrutiny is the legality, propriety, and sustainability of the bail order as it stood at the time of its grant. Where such an order is shown to suffer from non-application of mind, reliance on disputed or prima facie suspect material forming the subject-matter of trial, suppression or non-consideration of material facts, or disregard of binding legal principles, annulment of the bail order is not only permissible but warranted in order to avert a miscarriage of justice.

**Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972- Section 2(e) \-** A person who is governed by any other Act, or governed by any Rules providing for payment of gratuity, does not come within the ambit of the definition of “employee” under the PG Act. (Para 12\) \[Context: The Supreme Court upheld the High Court judgment holding that employees of Heavy Water Plant, Tuticorin (HWP) are not covered by the definition of Section 2(e) of the PG Act\]

**Jurisdictional Fact \-** A jurisdictional fact is a fact which must exist before a court, tribunal, or authority assumes jurisdiction over a particular matter. A jurisdictional fact is one on the existence or non-existence of which depends the jurisdiction of a court, a tribunal or an authority. It is the fact upon which an administrative agency’s power to act depends. If the jurisdictional fact does not exist, the court, authority or officer cannot act. If a court or authority wrongly assumes the existence of such a fact, the order can be questioned by a writ of certiorari. The underlying principle is that by erroneously assuming the existence of such a jurisdictional fact, no authority can confer upon itself jurisdiction which it otherwise does not possess. (Para 10\)

**Interpretation of Statutes \-** Coupling the word “means” with “includes” denotes an exhaustive definition. Conversely, the word “means” and “does not include” should be read as exclusionary language that strictly excludes the scope of the provision from certain classes. (Para 12\)

**Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (SC-ST Act) \- Section 14A :** Orders framing charge or refusing discharge are neither interlocutory nor final, but an appeal thereagainst would fall under Section 14-A (Para 17\) \- The provision does not curtail or dilute the ordinary appellate powers of the High Court. Consequently, the High Court does not function as a revisional or supervisory Court while exercising jurisdiction under Section 14-A but assumes the role of a first appellate court. A mechanical affirmation of the order of the Special Court, without independent scrutiny, would therefore be inconsistent with settled appellate jurisprudence and would amount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction. Even where the appellate Court ultimately agrees with the reasoning of the Courts below, the judgment must disclose that the material was independently examined- The appellate power under Section 14-A of the SC/ST Act must be exercised in harmony with the broader framework of criminal procedure. While the High Court is dutybound, as a first appellate Court, to independently apply its mind and correct errors committed by the Special Court, it must remain conscious of the stage of the proceedings and the corresponding limits of judicial scrutiny.(Para 19\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \- Sections 227, 228 \- Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 \- Sections 250,251 :** At the stage of framing of charge or considering discharge, the Court is not dealing with an abstract legal exercise. It is dealing with real people, real anxieties, and the real weight of criminal prosecution. Judicial responsibility at this stage calls for care, balance, and an honest engagement with the facts on record. The power to frame a charge is not meant to be exercised by default or out of caution alone. When the material placed before the Court, taken at face value, does not disclose the ingredients of an offence, the law expects the Court to have the clarity and courage to say so and to keep such a case aside. Discharge, in that sense, is not a technical indulgence but an essential safeguard. The Court must consciously distinguish between a genuine case that warrants a trial and one that rests only on suspicion or assumption or for that matter without any basis. To allow a matter to proceed despite the absence of a prima facie case is to expose a person to the strain, stigma, and uncertainty of criminal proceedings without legal necessity. Fidelity to the rule of law requires the Court to remember that the process itself can become the punishment if this responsibility is not exercised with care. (Para 20\)

**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 \- Section 250,251 : Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \- 227, 228 :** What the BNSS does is to change the procedural setting within which this discretion is exercised. The new statute introduces express timelines for the filing of discharge applications and for the framing of charges, and it expressly recognises the possibility of the accused being heard or examined through electronic means. These changes are regulatory in nature. They are aimed at structuring the process and reducing delay, not at transforming the judicial task itself. The Court’s obligation to apply its mind to the record, to hear both sides, and to record reasons where discharge is ordered remains exactly as before, as does the caution against weighing evidence or conducting a mini trial at these preliminary stages \- The established jurisprudence developed under the Cr.P.C. on the scope and limits of consideration at the stages of discharge and framing of charge continues to hold the field under the BNSS. (Para 11\)

**Trial Courts \-** Trial Courts, which are the first courts most people ever step into. For a litigant or an accused, the Trial Court is not just one level in a hierarchy. It represents the face of the judiciary itself. The sensitivity, fairness, and legal discipline shown at this stage shape how ordinary citizens understand justice. The impression a Trial Court creates, through its approach to facts and law, often becomes the impression people carry of the entire judicial system. That is why, at every stage and especially at the threshold, Trial Courts must remain alive to the human consequences of their decisions and to the trust that society places in them.(Para 21\)

**SC– ST Act \-Section 3(1)(r) 3(1)(s) and 3(2)(va) :** The accused must first commit an offence under the IPC, such as assault, robbery, or any other crime punishable with ten or more years of imprisonment. The act must be directed against a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, or against property that belongs to them, reflecting the special protection the law affords to historically marginalized communities. In addition, the accused must have knowledge that the victim belongs to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe or that the property belongs to such a person. This requirement of awareness is essential to the application of the law. Finally, the punishment prescribed under this sub-section is life imprisonment along with a fine, underscoring the gravity of offences committed against vulnerable communities. Section 3(2)(va) : To attract liability under this provision, the accused must commit one of the scheduled offences against a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe or their property. The offender must know the caste identity of the victim or that the property belongs to them, ensuring that the law applies to deliberate acts of caste-based harm. (Para 10\)

**SC– ST Act \-** The Act is a transformative instrument, bridging the gap between constitutional ideals and everyday realities, ensuring that SC/ST citizens can live as equal, dignified, and empowered members of society. (Para 9\)

**Environmental Law \-** Environmental protection must be pursued through lawful means. The mandate to clear the encroachments from the forest land does not authorise an arbitrary action. The Constitution does not envisage a choice between environmental protection and the rule of law, rather, it insists that both co-exist and reinforce each other. (Para 10\) \[**Context**: This case concerns with large-scale eviction notices issued to long-settled villagers residing inside various reserved forests in Assam, challenging those notices as arbitrary and violative of natural justice\]

**Constitution of India \-** The Constitution casts a clear and unequivocal obligation upon the state to protect forest and the environment.- Article 48A- Article 48A, forming part of Directive Principles of State Policy, mandates that the State shall endeavor to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country. Though, Directive Principles are not enforceable by Courts, they are fundamental in governance of the country and must guide the State in formulation and implementation of policy- **Article 51A(g) \-** Fundamental duty upon every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment, including forests. These constitutional provision reflect a collective responsibility on the part of citizen as well as the State to prevent, regulate and remedy the environmental harm.(Para 9\)

**Forests** \- Forests constitute one of the most vital natural resources of the nation. They are not merely repositories of timber or land capable of alternate use, but complex ecological systems indispensable for maintaining environmental balance. Forests regulate climate, preserve biodiversity, recharge groundwater, prevent soil erosion, and act as natural carbon sinks mitigating the adverse effects of climate 8 change. In a country as ecologically diverse and climatically vulnerable as India, the role of forests assumes even greater significance. Encroachment upon forest land has emerged as one of the gravest challenges confronting environmental governance in the country. (Para 9\)

(Para 25\)

**Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act)- Section 24 \-** (i) Section 24(1)(a) of the 2013 Act is applicable to all those cases where awards are passed after the commencement of the 2013 Act. (ii) For passing the award under Section 24(1)(a), the provisions of the 2013 Act alone will have to be followed, except for the rehabilitation and resettlement entitlements. (Para 97\)

**RFCTLARR Act \- Section 74 ; Land Acquisition Act 1894 \-** Section 54 The first appeals before the High Courts should be treated as ones under Section 74 of the 2013 Act and not under Section 54 of the 1894 Act. (Para 97\)

**RFCTLARR Act \- Section 74; Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 5 \-** Section 74 of the 2013 Act does not bar the application of Section 5 of the 1963 Act. (Para 97\)

**Limitation Act 1963 \- Section 29(2)-** The compliance of Section 29(2) is mandatory, with the exception arising only by way of an express exclusion. (Para 62\) Express exclusion is the general rule and implied exclusion is only an exception that comes into play depending on the nature and scheme of the concerned legislation. Therefore, the onus lies heavily on the party claiming an implied exclusion to show the same.(Para 90\) Mere incorporation of a specific period of limitation under the special or local law does not amount to express exclusion of the 1963 Act. Rather, it must indicate that Sections 4 to 24 of the 1963 Act are excluded. As a matter of rule, the said words must be present in the special or local law. (Para 59\)

**Interpretation of Statutes \-**Interpretation of a word or a provision must be made contextually with respect to each statute and, therefore, importing any understanding to a different statute would be fraught with dangerous consequences. (Para 87\) Any interpretation having the impact of destroying a right in seeking an adjudication on merits, should be eschewed unless it appears so on the very face of it. Even when two interpretations are possible, the one that facilitates the filing of an appeal must be approved. (Para 79\) When the Legislature introduces a provision, there can be no interpretation in ignorance of it. Such an ignorant interpretation would also be dangerous, as it would amount to striking down the very provision itself even without a challenge. (Para 78\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Section 15(2) \-** It would be impermissible for a court acting under Section 15(2) to adopt a procedure whereby it exercises jurisdiction barred to it by the Act. (Para 41\) High Court is not empowered to nullify orders which it had no jurisdiction to consider. (Para 42\) Where the Act provides procedures for assailing orders, or prohibits such orders of a Tribunal from being assailed, then no alternate procedure can be adopted by a court whose jurisdiction derives from a provision of the Act itself. (Para 40\) \[**Context**: SC held that while substituting an arbitrator under Section 15(2),ct, the Bombay High Court exceeded its limited jurisdiction by declaring arbitral proceedings conducted between 17.03.2022 and 25.08.2022 as a nullity on the ground of moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC. \]

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Section 15 \-** Section 15(3) provides the course of action after the arbitrator has been replaced under sub-section (2). The essential ingredients of the provision are thus:- i. Any hearing previously held may be repeated; ii. The repetition of the hearing is at the discretion of the arbitral tribunal; iii. However, such repetition of the hearing is subject to the agreement between the parties; If the parties agree for repetition of hearing, the term “may” transforms into “shall”. Whereas, if the parties agree for non-repetition of hearing, the term “may” transforms into “shall not”. In case the parties fail to arrive at a conclusion, the arbitral tribunal would decide whether the hearing already conducted before his substitution would be repeated \- The parties can come to an agreement on the question of re-hearing either prior to the stage of substitution being reached or after the arbitrator has been substituted. (Para 31\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Section 15 \-** Under Section 15(2), the appointment of the substitute Arbitrator must be in accordance with the original agreement or provision applicable to the appointment of the Arbitrator at the initial stage. (Para 32\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Section 11-** It affords the Court with a very limited scope essentially requiring the Court only to make prima facie finding that an arbitration agreement exists. (Para 3

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \- Section 37-** Section 37 provides for appeals against orders under Section 17 and also against orders accepting pleas under Section 16, though orders rejecting Section 16 applications are not subject to judicial interference under the Act. (Para 40\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 304B \-** It is one thing to make a demand for dowry and another thing to inflict cruelty or harassment in connection with such demand for dowry \-For sustaining the conviction under Section 304-B , it would be necessary for the prosecution to bring on record at least some instance of cruelty or harassment being caused to the woman in connection with any demand for dowry that results in her death occurring otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of the marriage. (Para 9\) \[**Context**: The mother‑in‑law of the deceased was convicted under Sections 304‑B and 316 IPC for dowry death and causing the death of a 34‑week fetus- Allowing appeal, SC observed: Only general allegations of “mental and physical harassment” with no specific instances showing that the appellant herself subjected the deceased to cruelty or harassment for dowry soon before her suicide, and also noted that she was not present at the matrimonial home at the time of death. \]

**Consumer Protection Act 1986 \-** The damages cannot be awarded merely on presumptions or whims and fancies of the complainant. To make out a case for award of damages, especially when the claim is to the tune of crores of rupees, some trustworthy and reliable evidence has to be led. (Para 22\)

**Consumer Protection Act 1986 \- Section 13 \-** The provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023\) are not strictly applicable for proceedings under the 1986 Act. The Commission is, however, bound to comply with the Principles of Natural Justice, save and except as laid down in sub-section (4) of Section 13\. (Para 17\) While trying a complaint the evidence of the parties could be taken on affidavits as provided in Section 13(4)(iii). The Commission is also empowered to issue commission for examination of any witnesses in terms of Section 13(4)(v) of the 1986 Act. It is akin to Order XVIII Rule 4 CPC, which also provides that in every case examination-in-chief of the witness shall be on affidavit. Further, witness could be examined by the court or the Commissioner appointed by it. The Commission also needs to follow the same system. In case the facts are taken in evidence and cross-examination is sought by the other side, the Commission can easily evolve a procedure permitting the other side to crossexamine the witnesses. The same can be done by putting certain questions in writing or through video conferencing or by appointment of a Commission. (Para 17.1)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 65 \-** Primary evidence is the rule, while secondary evidence is an exception admissible only in the absence of primary evidence. A party is generally required to produce the best evidence available; so long as the superior evidence (the original) is within a party's possession or reach, they cannot introduce inferior proof (secondary evidence). (Para 20.1) \- The introduction of secondary evidence is a two-step process, wherein, first, the party must establish the legal right to lead secondary evidence, and second, they must prove the contents of the documents through that evidence. The twin requirements are conjunctive (Para 21\) \-There is no requirement that an application must be filed to lead secondary evidence. While a party may choose to file such an application, secondary evidence cannot be ousted solely because no application was filed. It is sufficient if the party lays the necessary factual foundation for leading secondary evidence either in the pleadings or during the course of evidence. (Para 20.7)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 85**\- In the absence of an original or at least a secondary evidence, it is impermissible to apply Section 85 of the Indian Evidence Act to conclude the execution of document \- A photocopy of a document is no evidence unless the same is proved by following the procedure set out. (Para 23\)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \-** Courts should not by itself compare disputed signatures without the assistance of any expert, when the signatures with which the disputed signatures compared, are themselves not the admitted signatures. (Para 23\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 100,103 \- Second Appeal \-** The general rule is that findings of fact recorded by the trial and appellate courts are binding and will not be disturbed, even if they appear to be erroneous- However, this restriction is not absolute. Where the findings of fact are founded on assumptions, conjectures or surmises, or suffer from the vice of perversity, the High Court is well within its jurisdiction to interfere with findings of fact. The legality of a finding of fact, when challenged on the ground of perversity, itself constitutes a question of law and, therefore, may give rise to a substantial question of law under Section 100\. finding may be termed perverse where it is arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant and material evidence, by considering irrelevant material, or where it is based on no evidence or on wholly unreliable evidence. A decision based on no evidence is not confined to cases of complete absence of evidence, but also includes cases where the evidence on record, taken as a whole, is incapable of reasonably supporting the findings recorded. A finding that outrageously defies logic, suffers from irrationality, or is such that no reasonable person acting judicially could have arrived at it, is equally perverse in the eye of the law. Findings resting on the ipse dixit of the court or on conjecture and surmises reflect non-application of mind and stand vitiated on that ground as well \- Insofar as documentary evidence is concerned, an inference drawn from the contents of a document is ordinarily a question of fact. However, the legal effect of a document's terms, its construction involving the application of legal principles, or a misconstruction thereof gives rise to a question of law (Para 16\) The power under Section 103 CPC can be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and with circumspection. Before invoking this provision, the High Court must record a clear finding that the findings of fact recorded by the courts below are vitiated by perversity. In the absence of such a categorical finding, the exercise of power under Section 103 would fall outside the permissible limits of Section 100 of the CPC. (Para 16.7)

**Specific Relief Act 1963 \- Section 38 \-Suit For Perpetual Injunction \-** The plaintiff for the relief of perpetual injunction, along with prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss, must also prove the actual possession of the suit schedule on the date of filing of the suit \- Possession on the date of filing the suit is an essential requisite for granting perpetual injunction. The findings recorded are that the plaintiff was not in possession of the suit schedule property. In a suit for recovery of possession, one of the essential conditions is (i) entitlement, (ii) manner of entitlement, (iii) specifics on the date and mode of dispossession, and conversely (iv) what is the nature of possession claimed by the defendant, and how it is illegal- The person averring a right to continue in possession shall, as far as possible, give a detailed particularised specific pleading along with documents to support his claim and details of subsequent conduct which establish his possession- One who claims possession must give all such details as enumerated hereunder. They are only illustrative and not exhaustive: (a) who is or are the owner or owners of the property; (b) title of the property; (c) who is in possession of the title documents; (d) identity of the claimant or claimants to possession; (e) the date of entry into possession; (f) how he came into possession—whether he purchased the property or inherited or got the same in gift or by any other method; (g) in case he purchased the property, what is the consideration; if he has taken it on rent, how much is the rent, licence fee or lease amount; (h) If taken on rent, licence fee or lease—then insist on rent deed, licence deed or lease deed; (i) who are the persons in possession/occupation or otherwise living with him, in what capacity; as family members, friends or servants, etc.; (j) subsequent conduct i.e. any event which might have extinguished his entitlement to possession or caused shift therein; and k) basis of his claim that not to deliver possession but continue in possession.

**West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953** –The WBEA Act does not confer any power of substantive review upon the Revenue Officer, either expressly or by necessary implication (Para 91\) The power of review is essentially a core judicial function, and conferring such a power upon executive authorities, absent an express legislative mandate, would blur the constitutionally mandated demarcation between the executive and the judiciary, permit the executive authorities to sit in judgment over their own decisions, and erode the rule of law by diluting finality (Para 57\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 114 \- Order XLVII Rule 1** \- Only on the following grounds, a review would lie: **i**. **Discovery of new and important matter or evidence:** A review can be sought under this ground by an aggrieved litigant on the discovery of a certain new and important matter or evidence, which, after exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed. A review of a judgment is a drastic step, and a reluctant resort to it is proper only where a glaring omission or patent mistake or a grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility. A mere repetition, through different counsel, of old and overruled arguments, a second trip over ineffectually covered ground or minor mistakes of inconsequential import, are obviously insufficient or **ii. Mistake or error apparent on the face of the record \-**The error under this ground must be self-evident and should not require an exhaustive examination or argument to establish it,  or **iii. Any other sufficient reason:** For instance, inter alia, where the Court omits to notice or consider relevant statutory provisions ; an order arising out of a lack of jurisdiction \-**Scope of review:** The purpose of a review is to rectify manifest or exceptional wrongs. It is not for reappreciating facts or seeking a different conclusion. Thus, a review could not be an appeal in disguise by reappreciating the evidence and grounds which have already traversed or come to a conclusion. (Para 60-80) 

**Limitation Act, 1963 \- Article 124** \- While it is true that Constitutional Courts are not strictly bound by limitation in exercising their jurisdiction, the position is markedly different in respect of the review jurisdiction of Civil Courts governed by the CPC. Under Article 124 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act, 1963, an application for review is required to be filed within a period of thirty days from the date of the decree or order sought to be reviewed, subject only to extension upon sufficient cause being shown. (Para 83\)

**Decree**\- A decree passed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. (Para 88\)

**Constitution of India** \- Separation of power and independence of the judiciary have been considered integral parts of the basic structure of our Constitution \-eparation of powers provides the guarantee for the independence of the judiciary and also acts as a safeguard against arbitrariness, upholding democratic values and the rule of law.

**Motor Accident Compensation** \- The non-pecuniary loss arising from deprivation of love and affection is comprehended within the broader head of “consortium”. Consequently, no separate award under the head of loss of love and affection is warranted. \[But opined: The head of “future prospects” itself is a creation of judicial interpretation, evolved to respond to socioeconomic realities and the legitimate expectations of dependents. If the law is capable of recognising anticipated economic progression as a valid loss, it is not too clear why emotional deprivation manifested in loss of love and affection must be viewed as an impermissible head\]

**Motor Accident Compensation** \-The concept of future prospects is an integral component of “just compensation” and is not confined only to those in permanent government employment.  Where the deceased was self-employed or on a fixed salary and below the age of 40 years, an addition of 40% of the established income towards future prospects is compulsory. (Para 18\) 

**Motor Accident Compensation** \- The amount of compensation should be “just”, i.e., it implies that the determination is fair, reasonable and equitable by accepted legal standards and is not a bonanza. Though “just” compensation can never be prefect or absolute compensation, since loss of human life can never be compensated by monetary terms, the principle of awarding “just” compensation and assessing the extent of dependency would depend on examination of the unique situation of each individual case. The determination of income must be founded on proof placed on record and cannot rest on conjecture or assumptions divorced from evidence. (Para 12-16)

**Precedents** \- Judicial discipline demands that a Constitution Bench decision must prevail over a judgment of a Bench of lesser strength. (Para 23\)

**Quotes** \- The law must remain responsive to lived human realities, especially in cases involving the sudden rupture of familial bonds. (Para 26\)

In case of a party who has suffered an adverse order under Section 8(3) of the PMLA, relief under Section 8(7) of the PMLA can be sought for, provided there is new material that was not placed before or considered by the Adjudicating Authority under Section 8(3) of the PMLA, or by the higher forums, if so challenged \- An application under the second proviso to Section 8(8) of the PMLA can only be filed subject to satisfying the essential conditions laid down by Rules 2(b) and 3A of the 2016 Rules.

**Hindu Law \- Joint Family \- Partition** \- Separate enjoyment of portions, installation of irrigation facilities, or even obtaining borrowings individually, do not by themselves establish partition in law. What is required is a clear and unequivocal intention to sever the joint status. In the absence of any declaration or conduct evidencing an intention to divide, the inference of continued joint family status was inevitable. (Para 32\) proof of the mere existence of a joint family does not by itself render all properties as joint family properties, but equally, once it is established that ancestral properties yielding income existed and acquisitions were made during the continuance of the joint family, the burden shifts to the person asserting self-acquisition. (Para 29\) Hindu law does not require other coparceners to establish with precision the exact source of funds for each acquisition made by the Karta. Where acquisitions are made during the subsistence of the joint family, and where ancestral properties yielding income are shown to exist, properties acquired in the name of the Karta are ordinarily regarded as joint family properties unless the contrary is proved. (Para 30\)

**Will** \- When the testator was habitually signing documents but affixed only a thumb impression in the Will and the Will was allegedly executed barely 72 hours prior to death and that it was scribed by a close relative instead of a professional scribe; and that the scribe’s presence itself was doubtful due to election duty \- SC held: These circumstances clearly warranted a finding of suspicion.

### [**Pramod Kumar Navratna vs State of Chhattisgarh 2026 INSC 124 \- Rape \- Promise To Marry \- Marital Status Of Victim**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/02/Pramod-Kumar-Navratna-vs-State-of-Chhattisgarh-2026-INSC-124---Rape---Promise-To-Marry----Marital-Status-Of-Victim.pdf)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 375,376** \- The complainant was herself a married woman with a subsisting marriage and a child \-Quashing FIR \- SC held: Both parties were aware about the marital status of the victim and therefore it cannot be, by any stretch imagination said that the consent of the complainant has been vitiated or obtained on fraud and misrepresentation made by the accused- such a promise would not be legally enforceable or even capable of being acted upon as the victim herself was not eligible for marriage, neither on the date of the first alleged act of offence nor on any subsequent dates wherein the parties indulged in the sexual activities, till the point of the date of registration of FIR.

**Hindu Marriage Act,1955 \- Section 5 ; Special Marriage Act, 1954 \- Section 4** \- The law prohibits bigamous unions and therefore disallows parties from entering into a second marriage during the subsistence of their first marriage. (Para 19-20)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 376(2)(n):** Essential ingredients to constitute the said offence i.e. there should be a promise of marriage made by the accused solely with a view to obtain consent for sexual relations and without having any intent of fulfilling said promise from the very beginning, and that such false promise of marriage had a direct bearing on the prosecutrix giving her consent for sexual relations. Such genuine cases that deserve prosecution of the accused must be clearly demarcated from the litigation that arises from the cases of consensual relationships between consenting adults going acrimonious on account of dispute and disagreement or a future change of mind \- The expression “repeatedly” contemplates more than one act of sexual assault, committed at different points in time on the same victim \- This means a series of acts that are separate in nature and not a continuation of a single transaction. In genuine cases under Section 376(2)(n) of the IPC, the pattern is usually unmistakable; it is an initial act of sexual assault, followed by multiple acts under fear, pressure, captivity, or continued deceit, often when the woman is rendered vulnerable and unable to escape the situation. (Para 16\)

**West Bengal (Revision of Pay and Allowance) Rules, 2009 \-** To receive dearness allowance is a legally enforceable right that has accrued in favour of the respondents-employees of the State of West Bengal. Given its incorporation in RoPA Rules, the AICPI is the standard to be followed by the State of West Bengal for determination of ‘existing emoluments’ \- The employees of the appellant-State shall be entitled to release of arrears in accordance with this judgment for the time 2008-2019 \- Directions issued (Para 59\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 14 \-** The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity, encompassing livelihood, adequate nutrition, shelter, and basic amenities. This right, under Article 21, would lose its substantive meaning without a minimum standard of living. (Para 3\)

**Constitution of India \- Preamble \-** The Preamble of the Constitution, right at the outset of our founding charter, establishes this connection between dignity and material conditions of life. By committing the State to social and economic justice, equality, and fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual, the Preamble sets the philosophical foundation of the Indian welfare state. (Para 5\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 309 \-** Scope, enforceability, limitations and other aspects- (A) insofar as rules made under this Article direct something to be done in a specific manner, the Government must abide thereby. The same cannot be side-stepped by exercise of power under Article 162 of the Constitution. (B) This power cannot be circumscribed by any agreement or by function of estoppel. . (C) executive instructions have less force than statutory rules. No direction can be issued, which in effect is an amendment to the rules framed under this Article. (D) If, in the rules enacted under this Article, there exist some gaps, it is open for the Government to fill up such gaps by way of administrative instructions. (E) The power exercised under this Article must be exercised in a just, fair and reasonable manner for the same is not immune to the tests of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. (F) The rules made under this power, are generally prospective in operation unless a statute conferring/asking for rules made hereunder provides for such rules’ retrospective application. When retrospective application is directed, the date from which the rules in question are made retrospectively applicable should have reasonable nexus to the provisions contained in the rules. (G) Unless oblique motives can be demonstrated, it is not open for the Courts to redetermine methods of selection when the same has been done in accordance with the rules framed under this power. (H) The power under this Article to promulgate rules also carries with it, the power to amend the same, even retrospectively. (Para 26\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 14 \-** The principle of manifest arbitrariness under Article 14 refers to legislation that is capricious, irrational, lacking in reasoned principle, or excessive and disproportionate; such arbitrariness vitiates both subordinate and plenary legislation alike. (Para 38\)

**Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation** \- (i) legitimate expectation arises based on a representation or past conduct of a public authority; (ii) legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure followed in regular or natural sequence; (iii) legitimate expectation provides locus standi to a claimant for judicial review; (iv) the doctrine is mostly confined to a right of a fair hearing before a decision and does not give scope to claim relief straightaway; (v) the public authority should justify the denial of a person’s legitimate expectation by resorting to overriding public interest; and (vi) the Courts cannot interfere with the decision of an authority taken by way of policy or public interest unless such decision amounts to an abuse of power.

**Review Jurisdiction** \- The dismissal of a review petition is not a mere procedural event but a substantive judicial affirmation of the correctness of the earlier decision. It signals the end of the Court’s revisiting power and bestows upon the findings, a seal of finality, both factual and legal. The parties, having invoked and exhausted their right to seek reconsideration, are thereafter bound by those findings, which operate as res judicata in all future proceedings. This doctrine safeguards the integrity and conclusiveness of judicial decisions and ensures that litigation, once finally adjudicated and reaffirmed, is not perpetually reopened to uncertainty. (Para 47\)

**Delay and latches** \- Delay and latches do not defeat a claim on mere passage of time in all cases. It does defeat a claim, however, when the delay in question is unreasonable, unexplained and inequitable. Whether any of these vices affect a claim is to be determined inter-alia on the anvil of forum that has been invoked, the right that has been asserted and the consequences in granting the relief asked for. It is a doctrine of equity informed by public policy and judicial discretion. Delay is said to reflect acquiescence and waiver of right \- in cases where there is a continuing wrong/recurring cause of action as against completed causes of action, delay in bringing a challenge would not be fatal. (Para 57\)

### [**Premium Transmission Private Limited v. Kishan Subhash Rathod  2026 INSC 122 \- S.10 Industrial Disputes Act \- CLRA**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/02/Premium-Transmission-Private-Limited-v.-Kishan-Subhash-Rathod---2026-INSC-122---S.10-Industrial-Disputes-Act---CLRA.pdf)

**Industrial Disputes Act \- Section 2 \-Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970 \- Section 2 \-** Though the definition of “workman” under Section 2(1)(i) of the CLRA is textually derived from Section 2(s) of the ID Act, 1947, the two differ fundamentally in their juridical scope and the structural basis of the employment between employer and employee. The definition under ID Act is broad, which includes persons dismissed, discharged, or retrenched in connection with an industrial dispute to ensure they retain locus standi for adjudication. The CLRA, being regulatory in nature, contains no such “extended meaning” for terminated employees. Furthermore, the CLRA introduces a specific statutory exclusion for “out-workers” whereas the ID Act does not have this specific statutory exclusion. Under the ID Act, the status of such workers is determined by the “Control and Supervision Test”. If the employer controls how the work is done, they may still be workmen under ID Act, even if working off-site. Under CLRA, they are statutorily barred from the definition. Finally, the ID Act presupposes a direct privity of contract (masterservant relationship) between the management and the worker, whereas the CLRA definition strictly operates through the medium of a contractor, covering workers hired “by or through” a third party for the establishment’s work. (Para 9\)

**Industrial Disputes Act \- Section 10 \-** If a case falls within the second limb or Section 10(1) of the ID Act, the appropriate Government is within its jurisdiction to refer an apprehended dispute to the Labour Court. By applying the same rule of interpretation, it can be construed that the appropriate Government may refer an Industrial Dispute apprehended to the Board, Labour Court and Tribunal. (Para 34\) Even if an unfair labour practice is alleged, the applicable statute is the ID Act and the forum, the labour court. In the case of sham and nominal contracts, adjudicatory reliefs of the status of workman vis-à-vis the principal employer are a sine qua non for any other relief. (Para 36\) **Remedies Available if Notification Under Section 10(1) is Issued for Abolition of Contract Labour:** (1)The issuance of a Section 10 notification does not lead to the automatic absorption of contract workers as regular employees of the principal employer. (2) The immediate legal effect of such abolition is that the contract labour working in that specific process must cease to function in that capacity. The principal employer is prohibited from employing contract labour for that job thereafter. (3) The workers do not become unemployed immediately; they remain employees of the contractor. The contractor can utilize their services in any other establishment where contract labour is not prohibited-**Remedies Available if the Contract is Continued as a “Camouflage” (Sham Contract):** (1) If it is proved that the contract was a mere ruse or camouflage to hide the real employer-employee relationship and that the principal employer retained full control and supervision over the workers the contract is disregarded as a legal fiction (2) In such cases, workmen “will have to be treated as employees of the principal employer who shall be directed to regularise the services of the contract labour”. Unlike the Section 10 scenario, here the workers become direct employees of the company. They are entitled to back wages and benefits as if they were regular employees from the start (or a date determined by the Tribunal).(3) Determining whether a contract is “sham” or “genuine” involves disputed questions of fact (e.g., Who supervised the work? Who paid the wages? Who supplied the tools?). Therefore, only the Industrial Tribunal/Court can adjudicate the dispute. Writ Courts generally do not decide these disputed questions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. (Para 10.2.3)  **Modes and Methods of re-employment if discontinuation of the contract is valid** : If the principal employer intends to employ regular workmen for the work previously done by contract labour, they must give preference to the erstwhile contract labourers. (2) The principal employer cannot simply hire fresh candidates from the open market while ignoring the displaced contract workers. They are legally bound to consider the contract workers who were working in that establishment. (3) To ensure this "preference" is meaningful, the principal employer may relax maximum age limit and academic qualifications; specifically, nontechnical posts to accommodate experienced workers-

### [**P. Suresh v. D. Kalaivani 2026 INSC 121 \- Art.227 Constitution \- CPC \- Rejection Of Plaint \- Striking Off Pleading**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/02/P.Suresh-vs-D.Kalaivani.pdf)

**Constitution of India \- Article 227 ; Code of Civil Procedure \- Order VII Rule 11:** Once the specific provision under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC, is available, the High Court cannot exercise powers under Article 227 to reject or strike off the plaint. For such relief, the specific provision under Order VII Rule 11, CPC, will have to be resorted to, on the grounds mentioned in the said provision. (Para 7.4) . Availability of an alternative civil remedy and/or under the CPC shall be treated as complete and near total bar on the High Court to venture to invoke and exercise its power available under Article 227 of the Constitution, except where exercise of supervisory jurisdiction becomes absolutely necessary. (Para 9\)

**Order VI Rule 16 \- Order VII Rule 11 \-** Order VI Rule 16 deals with the striking out of a part or a section of the pleading which suffers from any of the kinds mentioned in the provision, such as unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous, vexatious, prejudicial, embarrassing or delaying the fair trial or abuse of the process of law. It would be stretching beyond the logic of law to interpret and imply that Order VI Rule 16 can be utilized and employed for striking down the entire plaint. Striking down the plaint or rejection of plaint on the legal grounds available in Order VII Rule 11, CPC is entirely different than striking out the infirm or abusive pleadings. (Para 6.4.1)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226,227 \-** The availability of alternative remedy shall be legitimately construed to displace the exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction by the High Court, is true not only for the purpose of exercising powers under Article 226 of the Constitution but also for the purpose of invoking Article 227 of the Constitution. (Para 7.2)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 173(8) \-** The power to direct further investigation in a case rests solely at the discretion of the Magistrate/Court concerned. In the event, the police/ investigation agency is of the opinion that further investigation is necessary in any particular case to cull out complete facts and truth in the case, it is binding upon them to file an appropriate application before the Magistrate/Court, without directing an order for further investigation by themselves. Once such an application is filed by the investigation agency, the Magistrate/Court would apply its judicial mind, in light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case and the reasons demonstrated by the investigating agency, in order to exercise its discretion for exercise of its power to decide whether or not further investigation is to be ordered under the purview of Section 173(8) CrPC.

**Child Custody \-** In matters of custody, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the children but nonetheless there are a host of other factors which weigh before the court while passing the final order of custody. These host of factors may include the conduct of the parties, their financial capacity, their standard of living, as well as the comfort and education of the children. \[**Context**: In this case, SC noted that the High Court had failed to properly consider the mother’s conduct, the Qatar custody revocation, the contempt order, and the children’s expressed inclination and held: While these aspects may not, by themselves, be the sole reason for determining custody, they are nevertheless necessary and relevant factors, and their cumulative effect was at least relevant for determining the custody arrangement.\]

### [**U.P. Junior High School Council Instructor Welfare Association v. State of Uttar Pradesh 2026 INSC 117- Art.23 Constitution \- Begar \- Contractual Teachers**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/02/U.P.-Junior-High-School-Council-Instructor-Welfare-Association-v.-State-of-Uttar-Pradesh---Art.23-Constitution---Begar---Contractual-Teachers.pdf)

**Constitution of India \- Article 23 \-** “Forced labour” to encompass any work or service rendered unwillingly as a result of force or compulsion- This Article takes a hit at every form of forced labour, whether it is a direct case of forced labour or case of forced labour hidden under the guise of voluntary work or contractual work. (Para 54\) \[**Context**: In this case, SC held that any action of the State/Union Government to employ instructors/teachers on a fixed honorarium of Rs.7,000/- per month as was initially fixed in 2013-14 amounts to ‘Begar’ and unfair practice which is violative of Article 23 of the Constitution \]

**Constitution of India \- Article 226**\- The existence of an alternative remedy under a statutory scheme does not operate as an absolute bar to the exercise of writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. This is particularly so in cases where the writ petition has already been entertained by the Court, pleadings have been completed, and the matter has been adjudicated on merits. In such circumstances, relegating the parties to an alternative forum would defeat the ends of justice and render the prior proceedings redundant \- where the facts so justify, the Court retains full discretion to entertain and decide a writ petition notwithstanding the availability of an alternative remedy. (Para 29-30)

**Teachers** \- Teachers command the highest respect in society and are revered/worshipful as Gods \- We must accord the highest regard and respect to our teachers at all levels, even at the level of the government, especially the primary teachers. They have to be compensated for their work most suitably. In fact, no honorarium would be enough to compensate the services rendered by our teachers. (Para 38\)**\[Context**: SC held that part time contractual instructors/teachers appointed in the Upper Primary School in the State of U.P. are entitled to revision of their honorarium of Rs.7,000/- per month which was initially fixed for the contract period of eleven months in the year 2013 and that the said revision has to take place, if not annually then periodically as per the discretion of the PAB. Since the PAB for the year 2017-18 had determined the said honorarium to be Rs.17,000/- per month, all instructors/teachers appointed under the scheme are entitled for the payment of the same at the above rate of Rs.17,000/- per month with effect from 2017-18 till further revision takes place.\]

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (pre 2015 amendment position) \- Section 11, 34, 37 \-** Not only will the parties be bound before the Arbitrator with regard to the finding on existence and validity of the arbitration agreement they will also be bound during the subsequent stages of the proceedings which will include the Section 34 application stage, the Section 37 appeal stage and before this Court. (Para 31\)

**Precedent and Res Judicata \-** A decision between two parties which sets out a principle of law will operate as a precedent for disputes between two other parties too. A precedent operates in rem. In contrast, a res judicata operates in personam between the same parties either in the later stage of the same litigation between them or in a different litigation between them- In res judicata, the correctness of the decision is normally immaterial and it does not matter whether the previous decision was right or wrong, unless the erroneous determination relates to the jurisdictional matter of that body.

**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 35 \-**As a matter of course, a notice under Section 35(3) BNSS is to be issued to an accused or any individual concerned, qua an offence punishable with imprisonment up to 7 years \-As long as a person to whom a notice under Section 35(3) BNSS is issued has complied and continues to comply with the terms of the notice then, it is not open for the police officer to arrest him unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police officer is of the opinion that he ought to be arrested. (Para 26\)

**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 35 \-** a. An arrest by a police officer is a mere statutory discretion which facilitates him to conduct proper investigation, in the form of collection of evidence and, therefore, shall not be termed as mandatory. b. Consequently, the police officer shall ask himself the question as to whether an arrest is a necessity or not, before undertaking the said exercise. c. For effecting an arrest, qua an offence punishable with imprisonment up to 7 years, the mandate of Section 35(1)(b)(i) of the BNSS, 2023 along with any one of the conditions mentioned in Section 35(1)(b)(ii) of the BNSS, 2023 must be in existence. d. A notice under Section 35(3) of the BNSS, 2023 to an accused or any individual concerned, qua offences punishable with imprisonment up to 7 years, is the rule. e. Even if the circumstances warranting an arrest of a person are available in terms of the conditions mentioned under Section 35(1)(b) of the BNSS, 2023, the arrest shall not be undertaken, unless it absolutely warranted. Page 22 of 22 f. Power of arrest under Section 35(6) read with Section 35(1)(b) of the BNSS, 2023, pursuant to a notice issued under Section 35(3) of the BNSS, 2023 is not a matter of routine, but an exception, and the police officer is expected to be circumspect and slow in exercising the said power.

**Consumer Protection Act 1986 \- Section 2(1)(d) \-**The determinative question is whether the dominant intention or dominant purpose behind purchasing the flat was to facilitate profit generation through commercial activity, and whether there exists a close and direct nexus between the purchase and such profit-generating activity \- The question of what constitutes ‘commercial purpose’ is a question of fact to be decided in the circumstances of each case based on the purpose to which the goods/properties were purchased- The mere act of purchasing immovable property, even multiple units, cannot ipso facto attract the exclusion clause of Section 2(1)(d) unless and until it is proved that the dominant purpose behind such purchase was commercial in nature. In absence of such proof, the purchasers cannot be excluded from the definition of ‘consumer’ under the 1986 Act. The mere factum of leasing out the flat does not, by itself, demonstrate that they purchased the property with the dominant purpose of engaging in commercial activity.(Para 17\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996– Section 29A:** An application under Section 29A(5) for extension of the mandate of the arbitrator is maintainable even after the expiry of the time under Sections 29A(1) and (3) and even after rendering of an award during that time. Such an award is ineffective and unenforceable. But the power of the court to consider extension is not impaired by such an indiscretion of the arbitrator. While considering the application, the Court will examine if there is sufficient cause for extending the mandate, and in the process, it may impose such terms and conditions as the situation demands. The Court will also take into account other factors such as reduction of the fee of the arbitrator under proviso to Section 29A(4) and also impose costs on parties if the fact situation so demands. Substitution is an option for the Court as the provision itself says, “it shall be open for the Court to substitute”, and it will be exercised carefully. If the mandate is extended, the arbitral tribunal will pick up the thread from where it was left, and seamlessly continue the proceeding from the stage at which the mandate had expired, and conclude within the time granted. (Para 23\)

**Interpretation of Statutes \-** While interpreting an enactment providing legal remedies for the resolution of disputes, a constitutional court has the obligation to ensure that the provision is: (a) accessible, (b) affordable, (c) expeditious and (d) cohesive. Accessibility requires the remedy to be easily available. Affordability is an aspect that is related to the cost of availing the remedy, it must be at a reasonable price. Expeditious nature of a remedy is concerned with the quick disposal and abhors unreasonable delays. Yet another facet of effective remedy is in its cohesiveness. (Para 22\)

**Representation of the People Act, 1951 \- Section 8A \-** The power to pass an order of disqualification rests with the President of India and not with the High Court which has set aside the election of a successful candidate. \[**Context**: Kerala High Court had set aside K.M.

**Summary:** The appellant Ram Singh’s 2012 election to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from 249 Patti Constituency had been declared void by the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) on grounds of improper rejection of postal ballots and non‑compliance with election laws, with further directions denying him benefits like pension and recommending strict action against the Returning Officer. The Supreme Court had earlier stayed the High Court’s judgment on 05.09.2016, and by the time of final hearing the 2012–2017 assembly term had already expired. In these circumstances, without examining the merits of the election dispute, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal in part by setting aside the adverse observations and directions contained in the High Court’s judgment.

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 7,8,11-** When an allegation of fraud is made with regard to arbitration agreement itself, such a dispute is generally recognised as a dispute, which is in the realm of nonarbitrability and the court will examine it, as a jurisdictional issue only to enquire whether the dispute has become nonarbitrable due to one or the other reason. (Para 15\) A party may be bound by the arbitral process only if it is first shown, even at a prima facie level, that such a party had agreed to submit disputes to arbitration. Where the arbitration agreement itself is alleged to be forged or fabricated, the disputes ceases to be merely contractual and strikes at the very root of arbitral jurisdiction. (Para 20\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 8,11 \-** When the existence of the arbitration agreement itself is in serious dispute and requires adjudication, appointment of an arbitrator would be premature and legally impermissible. (Para 23\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 227 \- Arbitration \-** The High Court, while exercising jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution, was not justified in dislodging the concurrent findings and directing reference of the dispute to arbitration, particularly when the very existence of the arbitration agreement was under serious doubt \- The supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution is not an appellate jurisdiction in disguise, and it does not permit reappreciation of evidence.

**Constitution of India \- Article 226, 243O**\- By virtue of the express constitutional embargo contained in Article 243-O of the Constitution of India, the High Court is precluded from exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution where a law enacted by the State Legislature provides for the remedy of an election petition to redress grievances arising during the course of an election. The election process cannot be lightly interdicted or stalled at the behest of an individual grievance. The right to contest or question an election being statutory in nature, must be strictly construed and exercised in accordance with the statute governing the field. The High Court must, therefore, eschew the grant of liberal interim reliefs in favour of individuals and instead remain mindful of the overarching public interest in ensuring the smooth and uninterrupted conduct of elections across the State. In respect of individual grievances, the ultimate and exclusive remedy lies by way of an election petition. Given the non-obstante nature of Article 243-O of the Constitution, its mandate is required to be adhered to in both letter and spirit. Where the statute provides a complete and efficacious mechanism for redressal, the extraordinary exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution would defeat the very object for which Article 243-O was enacted as a non-obstante provision. (Para 12\) \[**Context**: The Supreme Court set aside an interim order of the Uttarakhand High Court which had stayed rejection of the respondent’s nomination and directed that he be allowed to contest the Zila Panchayat election after the appellant had already been declared elected unopposed.\]

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 \- Section 7,9,10 ; National Company Law Tribunal Rules, 2016 \- Rule 28 \-** Till the objections in an application filed under Sections 7, 9 or 10 of the Code are removed, it is not to be treated as an application validly filed, as it is only after the application is complete in every respect that it is required to be entertained. \[**Context**: In this case, SC held : The mere filing of the company petition on 07.07.2021 did not result in the same being ‘registered’ on the file of the NCLT and it was only after rectification/amendment of the petition and upon its refiling, with the defects therein cured, that the same would have been registered. It was only after ‘registration’ of the company petition takes place under Rule 28(4) of the NCLT Rules that it would have been impermissible for the petitioning allottees to make any changes therein without the leave of the NCLT. As the changes in question were made by them prior to that event, no adverse inference can be drawn against them to non-suit them on that ground.\]

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 \- Section 7,9,10 \-** Can a joint company petition be filed for initiation of insolvency process against two separate companies? In this case, SC held: The corporate debtors were intrinsically linked and that it would be in their interest to have a joint insolvency process so as to maximise asset realisation. In any event, as they were jointly answerable to the allottees, the filing of a single company petition against them was justified.

Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 154 : Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 173 : FIR On Social Media Posts \- Supreme Court dismissed SLP filed against the judgment of Telangana High Court that had issued the following guidelines in cases where the registration of First Information Reports (FIRs) is sought in connection with social media posts: i. Verification of locus standi: Before registering any FIR for alleged defamation or similar offences, the police must verify whether the complainant qualifies as the "person aggrieved" in terms of law. Complaints by unrelated third parties lacking standing are not maintainable, except where the report concerns a cognizable offence. ii. Preliminary inquiry in cognizable offences: Where a representation/complaint discloses a cognizable offence, the police shall, prior to registration of crime, conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether the statutory ingredients of the alleged offence are, prima facie, made out. iii. High threshold for media post/speech-related offences: No case alleging promotion of enmity, intentional insult, public mischief, threat to public order, or sedition shall he registered unless there exists prima facie material disclosing incitement to violence, hatred, or public disorder. This threshold must be applied in line with the principles laid down in Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar, 1962 Supp (2) SCR 769, and Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, (2015) 5 SCC 1\. iv. Protection of political speech/post: The police shall not mechanically register cases concerning harsh, offensive, or critical political speech. Only when the speech amounts to incitement to violence or poses an imminent threat to public order may criminal law be invoked. Constitutional protections for free political criticism under Article 19(l)(a) of the Constitution must be scrupulously enforced. v. Defamation as a non-cognizable offence: Since defamation is classified as a non-cognizable offence, the police cannot directly register an FIR or crime in such matters. The complainant must be directed to approach the jurisdictional Magistrate. Police action may follow only upon a specific order of the Magistrate under Section 174(2) of the BNSS. vi. Compliance with arrest guidelines: In all cases, the police shall strictly comply with the principles laid down in Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273\. Automatic or mechanical arrests are impermissible, and the principle of proportionality in the exercise of criminal process must be observed. vii. Prior legal scrutiny in sensitive cases: In matters involving political speech/post or other sensitive forms of expression, the police shall obtain prior legal opinion from the Public Prosecutor before registering an FIR, to ensure that the proposed action is legally sustainable. viii. Frivolous or motivated complaints: Where a complaint is found to be frivolous, vexatious, or politically motivated, the police shall close the matter under Section 176(1) of the BNSS, citing absence of sufficient grounds for investigation.

**Maintenance \-** When a marriage breaks down, the obligation of the husband to ensure that the wife is able to live with dignity does not come to an end merely on the ground that she is educated or has parental support. Post-divorce, the wife is entitled to live a life consistent with the standard of living she was accustomed to during the subsistence of the marriage. \[**Context**: Supreme Court enhanced the permanent alimony to **Rs. 30,000 per month** from the date of filing of the SLP (02.07.2021) and directed payment of arrears of Rs. 8,10,000 for July 2021–January 2026 in lump sum or in instalments over four years.\]

**Marriage \-** Marriage, as an institution in our society, is founded on emotional bonding, companionship, and mutual support, which cannot be evaluated in purely monetary terms. A woman often enters matrimony with legitimate aspirations of a stable and dignified life.

**Chhattisgarh Education Services (Collegiate Branch) Recruitment Rules, 2019- Rule 12(7) \-** Merely an enabling provision that permits, but does not compel, the Public Service Commission to recommend a candidate from the waiting list when a selected candidate resigns, and therefore does not create an enforceable right in favour of the wait‑listed candidate. In light of amended Rule 19.6 of the Chhattisgarh Public Service Commission Procedure Rules, 2014, any post falling vacant due to resignation after assumption of charge is not to be treated as vacant at all, so the Commission had no discretion left to make a recommendation from the wait list for that post. On this reasoning, the Court set aside the High Court’s direction to appoint the respondent from the waiting list and allowed the State’s appeal \-By use of word ‘can’ in place of ‘shall’, the legislature /the rule making authority has left a degree of discretion with the Commission to recommend or not to recommend from the wait list in the given eventuality.

However, the oral termination in the instant case at the first instance being without holding any inquiry and thereafter, transferring the appellant to a far-off place not being warranted and as a result of the same, the disciplinary proceedings having been initiated, we are of the considered view that the entire issue can be laid to rest by directing the respondent-Trust to pay a lump-sum compensation of Rs.12,00,000/- (Rupees Twelve Lakhs) since the appellant had worked for twelve years in the said Trust continuously, uninterruptedly and without any blemish.

We understand that Courts bear the burden of heavy dockets, featuring several matters that demand prioritization. Among the miscellaneous matters, nothing can be more important than deciding the fate of an application for bail – if people continue to languish in jails, their bail applications are not being heard, and there is an air of uncertainty surrounding when they will get to know the fate of their applications, we believe that this Court is under a bounden duty to lay down certain mandatory guidelines- High Courts to send complete details of the anticipatory bail/regular bail/suspension of sentence applications pending in the respective High Courts, along with the date of filing, date of decision, or the next date of hearing- All the State Governments are directed to fully cooperate with the High Courts for early and time-bound adjudication of the bail applications/prayer for suspension of sentence. The States should be ready with the relevant information as and when the bail applications are listed for hearing, provided that a copy thereof has been submitted in the office of the learned Advocate General and/or the learned Public Prosecutor at least three days in advance.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 372,378 \- Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 \- Section 138 \-** Can a complainant in a case arising under Section 138 NI Act file an appeal under the proviso to Section 372 without seeking special leave to appeal under Section 378(4) ? Supreme Court doubts correctness of its judgment in [Celestium Financial versus A. Gnanasekaran](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2025/06/2025-INSC-804-Celestium-Financial-vs-A.-Gnanasekaran---S.372-CrPC---Victim-s-Right-To-Appeal---Cheque-Bounce-Cases.pdf) \- Referred to Larger Bench and observed: We are also unable to agree with the interpretation placed by the co-ordinate Bench upon the scheme of the Code in the context of Sections 372 and 378 thereof. Perusal of Section 378(1), (2) and (3) of the Code reflects that the proviso to Section 372 thereof was carved out, keeping in mind the distinction between the prosecuting agency and the victim. We may also notice that Section 378(4) and (5) were preserved in the Code, which make it incumbent upon the complainant, who initiated the prosecution on a complaint which resulted in acquittal, to obtain leave before an appeal is filed before the High Court.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 313 \-** Great care is expected of Sessions Judges, who try grave cases to collect every incriminating circumstance and put it to the accused even though at the end of the long trial, the judge may be a little fagged out \-It is the duty of the public prosecutor to assist the trial court in recording the statement of the accused under Section 313 of the Code; if the court omits to put any material circumstances brought on record against the accused, the public prosecutor must bring it to the notice of the court while the examination of the accused is being recorded; he must assist the court in framing the questions to be put to the accused; and as it is the duty of the public prosecutor to ensure that those who are guilty of the commission of offence must be punished, it is also his duty to ensure that there are no infirmities in the conduct of the trial, which will cause prejudice to the accused. \[**Context**: In this case, SC noted that no specific questions were put to accused apropos each piece of incriminating evidence adduced against them. The judgments of the trial court based on such inadequate examination of the accused, therefore, cannot be sustained.\]

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \-** While allowing appeal against High Court judgment that refused to quash a rape case, Supreme Court observed: Ordinarily, heinous crimes are not to be quashed basis a settlement between the parties because they have wider ramifications as the society at large is affected. However, this appears to be a case of two persons who were in a relationship but could not convert their relationship into a marital bond due to family differences. The allegation that the prosecutrix was exploited when she was a minor would be difficult to prove because on that date POCSO Act was not in force and therefore, the benefit of presumption thereunder would not be available to the prosecution. Moreover, when FIR was lodged, prosecutrix was an adult. In such circumstances, it would be difficult to ascertain whether she was violated when she was a minor.

**Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 \-** While permitting a woman to undergo medical termination of pregnancy, Supreme Court observed \- She was a minor when she conceived and has to face this unfortunate situation of having a pregnancy owing to a relationship that she had. The fact that presently she has crossed eighteen years of age is an irrelevant factor \-The question whether the relationship was consensual or whether it was a case of sexual assault is not the issue to be considered \-Ultimately, the denominator is the fact that the child to be born is not out of a wedlock and secondly, the mother to be of the child does not want to bear such a child.  If the interest of the mother is to be taken note of, then her reproductive autonomy must be given sufficient emphasis. The court cannot compel any woman, much less a minor child, to complete her pregnancy if she is otherwise not intending to do so. (Para 15-20)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Substitution Application \-** High Court rejected the delay condonation application and consequently, substitution application merely for the reason that court presumed that since the parties were resident of same locality, they were aware of the death \- Allowing appeal, SC held: No such presumption in law exists.
