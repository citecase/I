The extension of mandate or substitution of an arbitrator under Section 29A does not partake the character of “appointment” under Section 11, but is a measure designed to ensure timely conclusion of arbitration -The expression “Court” in Section 29A must, therefore, be accorded the meaning assigned to it under Section 2(1)(e).(Para 23) The view that there will be hierarchical difficulties, conflict of power or jurisdictional anomaly if a Civil Court entertains application under Section 29A for extension of time of an arbitral tribunal if the High Court under Section 11(6) of the Act has appointed the arbitrator(s) is untenable.

Construction and interpretation of a contract and its terms is a matter for the arbitral tribunal to determine.

If there are two plausible interpretations of the terms of a contract, then no fault can be found if the arbitrator accepts one such interpretation as against the other. To be in conflict with the public policy of India, the award must contravene the fundamental policy of Indian law, which makes it narrower in its application. (Para 59)</span> |

Notwithstanding the dates from which these two enactments were brought into force, the BOCW Act and the Cess Act remained dormant, in fact, owing to the failure of the appropriate Governments in taking necessary measures to bring the provisions thereof into actual effect -The Cess Act is complementary to the BOCW Act and was enacted for augmenting the resources of the Welfare Boards, constituted under Section 18 of the BOCW Act. Therefore, in the absence of such Welfare Boards, levy and collection of cess under the Cess Act did not arise, given the scheme and structure of the two Acts and the Rules - constitution of Welfare Boards was essential and was a condition precedent for levy and collection of the cess in relation to the BOCW Act and the Cess Act. The registration of workers or providing of welfare measures to them, however, are not pre-conditions for the levy and collection of such cess. (Para 59)</span> |

The appellate power under Section 37 of the Act is exercisable only to find out if the court exercising power under Section 34 of the Act, has acted within its limits as prescribed thereunder or has exceeded or failed to exercise the power so conferred. The Appellate Court exercising powers under Section 37 of the Act has no authority of law to consider the matter in dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal on merits so as to hold as to whether the award of the Arbitral Tribunal is right or wrong. The Appellate Court in exercise of such power cannot sit as an ordinary court of appeal and reappraise the evidence to record a contrary finding.

In the event, the courts are allowed to step in at every stage and the arbitral awards are subjected to challenge before the courts in hierarchy before court of first instance, through regular appeals and finally by means of SLP/Civil Appeal before the Supreme Court, it would obviate/frustrate and defeat the very purpose of the Act. It is therefore, necessary to accept the arbitral award if it is not patently illegal or does not fall within the scope of intervention under Section 34 of the Act. The appeal thereof has a much narrower scope of intervention particularly when the arbitral award has been upheld under Section 34 of the Act. The appellate jurisdiction acquires little significance only when the arbitral award has been erroneously upheld or set aside by the court in exercise of its power under Section 34 of the Act.

The arbitrator’s fees were set according to the Fourth Schedule of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. When the respondent filed a counter-claim, the total fees were revised to Rs. 37.50 lakh based on the ceiling set in the Fourth Schedule. Following objections and the refusal of both the appellants and the respondent to pay their equal share of the revised fees, the Sole Arbitrator terminated the arbitral proceedings on March 28, 2022, under Section 38 of the Act. The appellants’ attempt to get a new arbitrator appointed via a subsequent Section 11 petition was rejected by the High Court, leading to the appeal before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ultimately partially allowed the appeal, ordering the appointment of a substitute arbitrator based on the unique facts and the historical uncertainty surrounding the determination of fees and termination remedies at that time. |

There is no mandatory prerequisite for issuance of a Section 21 notice prior to the commencement of Arbitration. Issuance of a Section 21 notice may come to the aid of parties and the arbitrator in determining the limitation for the claim.
