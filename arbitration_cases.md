Registry cannot make inroads into areas within the exclusive domain of the judiciary and seek clarification as to why a particular party has been joined as a respondent. Unnecessary parties could be deleted by the High Court referring to principles flowing from Order I Rule 10, CPC. If any party has been mischievously joined with an intention to harass him or with some hidden ill-motive, it is open to the High Court to unearth the truth and deal with the situation appropriately on the judicial side. (Para 11) \[Context: In this case, the High Court had upheld the registry objections relating to the form of the prayer and the array of parties in the writ petition - Supreme Court set aside the HC order\]</span> |

Should the court find the suitor entitled to a lesser relief than the larger or wider relief claimed, there is no bar in granting such lesser relief -A court cannot grant a larger or wider relief to the suitor than that claimed by him - The grounds on the existence of which rejection of a plaint is permissible are traceable to Order VII Rule 11, CPC whereas dismissal of a writ petition at the threshold is permissible on several grounds raised as objections to maintainability - rejection of a writ petition on the ground that multiple relief has been claimed in a single prayer is, perhaps, unprecedented. Even, moulding of relief without insisting on amendment of the prayer clause, should a case be set up therefor, is not unknown to writ jurisprudence. (Para 10)</span> |
