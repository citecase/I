Axis Bank Ltd 2026 INSC 84 \- Writ Petition \- Registry Objection**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/01/Sri-Mukund-Maheswar-v.-Axis-Bank-Ltd-2026-INSC-84---Writ-Petition---Registry-Objection-.pdf) | 2026 INSC 84 | **Constitution of India \- Article 226 ; Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order I Rule 10 \- Practice and Procedure \- Registry \-** It is for petitioner to decide who is to be joined as a party and who is not to be joined. Registry cannot make inroads into areas within the exclusive domain of the judiciary and seek clarification as to why a particular party has been joined as a respondent. Unnecessary parties could be deleted by the High Court referring to principles flowing from Order I Rule 10, CPC. If any party has been mischievously joined with an intention to harass him or with some hidden ill-motive, it is open to the High Court to unearth the truth and deal with the situation appropriately on the judicial side. (Para 11\) \[Context: In this case, the High Court had upheld the registry objections relating to the form of the prayer and the array of parties in the writ petition \- Supreme Court set aside the HC order\] |

Axis Bank Ltd 2026 INSC 84 \- Writ Petition \- Registry Objection**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/01/Sri-Mukund-Maheswar-v.-Axis-Bank-Ltd-2026-INSC-84---Writ-Petition---Registry-Objection-.pdf) | 2026 INSC 84 | **Constitution of India \- Article 226 ; Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order VII Rule 7, 11-** Order VI Rule 17 When a suitor claims a larger or wider relief than what he is entitled to, his claim (be it a writ petition or a suit) cannot be dismissed by the court on that ground. Should the court find the suitor entitled to a lesser relief than the larger or wider relief claimed, there is no bar in granting such lesser relief \-A court cannot grant a larger or wider relief to the suitor than that claimed by him \- The grounds on the existence of which rejection of a plaint is permissible are traceable to Order VII Rule 11, CPC whereas dismissal of a writ petition at the threshold is permissible on several grounds raised as objections to maintainability \- rejection of a writ petition on the ground that multiple relief has been claimed in a single prayer is, perhaps, unprecedented. Even, moulding of relief without insisting on amendment of the prayer clause, should a case be set up therefor, is not unknown to writ jurisprudence. (Para 10\) |

This Court is of the view that the test akin to a test under Order VI Rule 4 CPC is applicable to such a pleading and clever drafting creating illusion of cause of action would not be permitted and a clear right to sue would have to be shown in the plaint.

If the interest of the deceased party is sufficiently represented by other parties already on record, and the decree/order eventually passed in the suit or proceeding would not be rendered non-executable for absence of that party, the suit or proceeding would not abate.

Reason being that the transferee/ third party cannot be subjected to special covenants, if any, between the vendor and the plaintiff-purchaser. Besides that, the object of the decree of specific performance is to put the person who has agreed to purchase the property in the same position which he would have obtained in case the contracting parties i.e., vendor and the purchaser had, pursuant to the agreement, executed a deed of sale and completed it in every way. |

Order XLI Rules 3A and 5(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, make this position amply clear in the context of belated presentation of civil appeals. (Para 14\) |

Tarun Keshrichand Shah and Ors 2026 INSC 8 \- CPC \- Dominus Litis \- Necessary & Proper Party**](https://www.caseciter.com/content/files/2026/01/NAK-Engineering-Company-Pvt.-Ltd.-v.-Tarun-Keshrichand-Shah-and-Ors--2026-INSC-8---CPC---Dominus-Litis---Necessary---Proper-Party.pdf) | 2026 INSC 8 | **Code of Civil Procedure 1908** \- Plaintiffs who have instituted the suit are dominus litis and it is for them to choose their adversaries. If they do not array the proper and necessary parties to the suit, they do it at their own risk. However, they cannot be compelled to add a party to defend a suit against their wishes. The decree, if any, passed in the suit would be binding only between the parties to the suit and would not infringe upon any right of a third party \- A necessary party is one without whom, no order can be made effectively, a proper party is one in whose absence an effective order can be made but whose presence is necessary for a complete and final decision on the question involved in the proceeding.
