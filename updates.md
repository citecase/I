Abhijit Pandey v. State of Madhya Pradesh 2026 INSC 83 - S.80 BNS - Bail - Dowry Death


Indian Penal Code 1860 - Section 80,108 -Bail - The accused, a dentist, was charged under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and the Dowry Prohibition Act in connection with the death of his wife, an anaesthetist - Allowing appeal, SC granted bail noticing that (1) FIR was originally for abetment of suicide based on alleged extra‑marital relationship, (2) the initial witness statements did not mention dowry demand, that the injuries did not appear to be the direct cause of death, (3) the deceased likely died due to Atracurium Besylate Injection, a drug she was professionally familiar with (4) the lack of hardened criminal background, (5) his custody since 25.03.2025.


Nirmala Bai v. Mansingh - Motor Accident Compensation


Motor Accident Compensation - Claimants claimed that deceased was cultivating land and involved in animal husbandry and milk vending - SC held: Even if the land which may be owned by the family is still subsisting the contribution of the male member of the family needs to be assessed. There is vast difference between the quality of contribution by a family member as compared to an employee. His working hours are not fixed. Any person who has an opportunity certainly tries to do as much work as he can do to support his family and also see that they live in comfort. Farming is not a regular vocation. The farmers remain engaged in doing animal husbandry and milk vending as well side by side, which also generates extra income for them - The income of the deceased can be increased from ₹5,000/- per month, as taken by the High Court, to ₹8,000/- per month. 


Vinod Gandhi v. District Collector, Madurai - Limitation Act - Delay Condonation - State Interest


Limitation Act - Section 5 - Delay Condonation - The interest of State cannot suffer for the acts of omission/commission of its officers. [Context: Supreme Court refused to interfere with Madras High Court order condoning a very long delay in filing a review petition by the District Collector, Madurai, against a 2007 second appeal judgment that had upheld the petitioner’s vendor’s title and patta, on which third‑party rights had also been created. ]

Asif Ali v. Rajesab - S.20 SRA -Discretion - Specific Performance


Specific Relief Act 1963 - Section 20 (prior to 2018 amendment)- The discretion to be exercised in a case for specific performance of a contract must be sound and reasonable and not arbitrary. Even if it is lawful to grant the relief, it may not be granted by the court of law in exercise of its discretion judiciously. [Context: The Trial Court, the First Appellate Court and the High Court had all decreed/affirmed specific performance, but the Supreme Court, applying the discretionary principles in Section 20, held that in the circumstances it was not appropriate to compel execution of the sale deed. Instead, the Court granted the alternative relief of refund.]


Rakesh Jain v. State - S.409 IPC - Company Director - Presumption On Culpability


Indian Penal Code 1860 - Section 409 - The allegations of diversion of funds by the Company - In an offence punishable under Section 409 IPC there is no presumption regarding culpability of a Director. The same would have to be established in a trial. (Para 13) [Context: The appeal arose from a Delhi High Court order refusing to extend interim bail to Rakesh Jain, a director of M/s Pragat Akshay Urja Limited, accused in an FIR alleging diversion of subsidy funds under sections 409/120B IPC - The Court found it improper that the High Court had repeatedly deferred deciding the regular bail application for want of further deposit. The Court directed the High Court to decide the regular bail application expeditiously.]


A. Shankar @ Savukku Shankar v. Secretary to Government -Writ Jurisdiction - Direction To File ChargeSheet


Constitution of India - Article 226 - High Court Direction for filing of charge-sheets by the investigating agency - If the High Court directs, at a stage prior to conclusion of investigation, that a charge-sheet has invariably to be filed upon closure of investigation in a particular case irrespective of what the materials are which have been collected during investigation and without allowing the investigating officer to form his own opinion as regards the next course of action, that would take away the discretion of such officer and he would be left with no other option but to proceed in the direction as required by the high court under pain of threat of contempt. Other than very extreme cases, the high courts ought to exercise restraint and not issue such directions which foreclose the discretion of the executive. [Context: The appellant had filed a writ petition before the Madras High Court seeking action on his complaints alleging abuse of power and false cases by the police, but the High Court, while dismissing the writ, went on to direct the police to file charge‑sheets in pending cases within four months and the trial courts to complete trials within six months - In Appeal, set aside this direction issued by the High Court.]


Constitution of India - Article 226 ; Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 482 ; Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 - Section 528- If any investigation is in progress, the accused generally cannot complain about its mode and manner before the writ court unless the First Information Report does not even prima facie disclose an offence or there are other vitiating factors and even then, only in rare cases can a writ court intervene to halt the investigation- It is the duty of the investigating officer to conduct free, fair and proper investigation and, thereafter, file an appropriate report in terms of Section 173, Cr. PC/Section 193, BNSS. If at all any procedure is given a go-bye in the process, the Cr. PC or the BNSS provides the remedy to the accused which, alone, ordinarily ought to be pursued.  (Para 19)


Quote - None can be put in a worse position for approaching the court of law and find himself in a position more disadvantageous than the position he was in, on the date he moved the court.  (Para 8)

Hemalatha (D) v. Tukaram (D) 2026 INSC 82 - Registered Sale Deed - Declaration As Sham Document - Presumption About Validity & Genuineness


Specific Relief Act 1963 - Section 34 - Declaration Suit - Registered Sale Deed -Strong presumption about the validity and genuineness- A Court must not lightly or casually declare a registered instrument as a “sham” - The burden of proof to displace this presumption rests heavily upon the challenger. Such a challenge can only be sustained if the party provides material particulars and cogent evidence to demonstrate that the Deed was never intended to operate as a bona fide transfer of title - The grounds typically accepted to challenge a registered Deed at the instance of the vendee/executant are fraud or want of capacity in any party or mistake of fact or fundamental illegality like where the Deed was executed under deceit or sold by a fraudster who did not own the land or where the Deed was executed without consideration, namely, if no money or value was actually exchanged despite recitals in the Deeds or where there was coercion or intimidation like where the seller was forced to sign without free consent. (Para 31-32) 


Pleading Standards - Code of Civil Procedure - Order VI Rule 4 - The person alleging that a registered Deed is a sham must satisfy a rigorous standard of pleading by making clear, cogent, convincing averments and provide material particulars in his pleadings and evidence. This Court is of the view that the test akin to a test under Order VI Rule 4 CPC is applicable to such a pleading and clever drafting creating illusion of cause of action would not be permitted and a clear right to sue would have to be shown in the plaint. (Para 34)


Registration - Registered documents must inspire certainty; they cannot be rendered precarious by frivolous litigation- caution against the growing tendency to challenge registered instruments ‘at the drop of a hat'. (Para 33)


Indian Evidence Act, 1872 - Section 91,92 -Mere suspicion or nebulous averments without material particulars would not be sufficient to dislodge the presumption under Sections 91 and 92. (Para 35)


Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - Section 58- The condition precedent for arriving at a finding that the transaction involves mortgage by way of conditional sale is that there must be an ostensible sale and the condition that on default of payment of mortgage money on a certain date, the sale shall become absolute or on condition that on such payment being made the sale shall become void, or on condition that on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller shall be embodied in the same document-A deeming fiction was added in the negative that a transaction shall not be deemed to be a mortgage unless the condition for reconveyance is contained in the document which purports to effect the sale. (Para 48-49)


Indian Contract Act, 1872 - Section 25 - Mere allegation of inadequacy of consideration does not make the Deed void. It is only in the absence of sale consideration being tendered that the sale deed would be void. (Para 60)


Revenue Entries - Revenue entries in the municipal records do not prove ownership. (Para 63)


Registration - Reforms - Urgent need for the digitization of registered documents and land records using secure, tamper-proof technologies such as Blockchain. Many experts believe that Blockchain, a shared, digital record book (ledger) system would ensure that once a transaction of a sale or mortgage or like nature is recorded, it becomes immutable and cryptographically secured- Such reforms are essential to minimize the scourge of forgery and "clever drafting" that clogs our judicial system. Registered documents must inspire absolute confidence to ensure the ease of doing business and to uphold the sanctity of property titles in a modern economy. (Para 76-77)


Gloster Limited v. Gloster Cables Limited & Ors., 2026 INSC 81 - S.60 IBC - Trademark Title


Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 - Section 60 - The interpretation of the phrase “arising out of or in relation to the insolvency resolution or liquidation proceedings of the corporate debtor or corporate person under this Code” will have to be contextualized with the facts arising in a given CIRP - The examination in each case will depend on the facts as they present themselves in a given CIRP - In this case, SC held that NCLT could not, under Section 60(5)(c) IBC, declare title to the trademark “Gloster” in favor of the Successful Resolution Applicant. (Para 25-37)


Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 - Sections 43,55- To make out a case under Sections 43 and 45 of the IBC, rigorous scrutiny of documents and threadbare examination of the transactions needed to be undertaken and it could not have been carried out superficially- Section 47- If the Resolution Professional, in a given CIRP does not move an application, resort to Section 47 of the IBC could be had vis-à-vis undervalued transactions by a creditor, member or a partner of a corporate debtor as the case may be and they may move an application to the Adjudicating Authority to declare such transactions void and reverse their effect in accordance with the provisions of the IBC. (Para 43) -The parties mentioned therein while moving an application under Section 47, ought to set out sufficient materials and the party against whom the relief is sought ought to be put on notice of the averments and the relief prayed. (Para 49)


Naveen Kumar Sah v. State of Bihar - CrPC/BNSS - Quashing - Chargesheet Filed


Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 173, 482 : Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita - Section 528 - A petition to quash the FIR does not become infructuous on submission of a police report under Section 173(2) of the CrPC, but when a police report has been submitted, particularly when there is no stay on investigation, the Court must apply its mind to the materials submitted in support of the police report before taking a call whether the FIR and consequential proceedings should be quashed or not. [Context: The Supreme Court set aside a Patna High Court order that had quashed an FIR without considering a charge-sheet already filed by the Investigating Agency. ]


Superintending Engineer v. Labour Court Madurai - Disciplinary Proceedings - Probation - Conviction Stigma
Disciplinary Proceedings - Probation of Offenders Act - Section 12- Release of offenders on probation does not obliterate the stigma of conviction. (Para 9)
Viraj Impex Pvt. Ltd. vs Union of India ; 2026 INSC 80 - Delegated Legislation - FTDR Act - Gazette Publication
Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 - Section 3 - Notification issued under Section 3 of the Act acquires the force of law only upon its publication in the Official Gazette. The expression ‘date of this Notification’ must necessarily mean the date of such publication - DGFT Minimum Import Price notification acquired force of law only upon publication in the Official Gazette on 11.02.2016, not on the earlier website upload. (Para 22-23)
Legislation - Law, to bind, must first exist. And to exist, it must be made known in the manner ordained by the legislature (Para 16)- Before a law can become operative, it must be promulgated or published - It must be broadcast in some recognisable way so that all men may know what it is, or, at the very least, there must be some special rule or regulation or customary channel by or through which such knowledge can be acquired with exercise of due and reasonable diligence. (Para 17) 
Delegated Legislation - Publication of promulgation is indispensable to enforceability of subordinate legislation- When the parent statute prescribes a particular mode of publication, that mode must be strictly followed (Para 18)- The true test of the effective commencement of a statutory order or subordinate legislation is whether it has been published in a manner reasonably calculated to bring it to the notice of all persons who may be affected by it, namely, through a mode which is ordinarily and generally accepted for that purpose. (Para 17) Once the legislature has prescribed the specified mode of promulgation, the executive cannot introduce an alternative mode and attribute legal consequences to it. (Para 19)

Sewak Ram v. State of Uttar Pradesh - Murder Case
Indian Penal Code 1860 - Section 302,304 - The appellant, originally convicted for murder under Section 302 IPC and sentenced to life, had his conviction modified by the High Court to Section 304 Part II with a ten-year sentence, finding uncertainty that his shot caused the death. The Supreme Court noted the unchallenged High Court finding, the appellant’s age (84), and held that the sentence already undergone meets the ends of justice, allowing the appeal in part. Pending applications were disposed of accordingly.
Practical Solutions Inc. v. State of Telangana - CrPC/BNSS - Quashing FIR
________________


Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 482, 41A - Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 - Section 528,35 - In a petition where quashing of the FIR is prayed for, the High Court should not have passed an order directing the Investigating Officer to comply with Section 41-A Cr.PC because it indirectly amounts to granting a relief which High Court could have considered only if a prima facie case for quashing of the FIR is made out.

Indian Penal Code 1860 - Section 456 - Criminal Trial - Sentencing - Long passage of time without repeat offence, particularly the cases involving short custodial sentences and non-heinous crimes constitute a valid ground for exercising discretion in favour of reduction of sentence. (Para 8)

20th January, 2026
Raj Singh Gehlot v. Amitabha Sen 2026 INSC 77 - Writ Petition - Burden Of Proof - S.14 NGT Act
Constitution of India - Article 226 - In a writ petition, which is decided on affidavits, the burden of establishing the existence of the facts asserted squarely lies upon the writ petitioner, and such burden can be discharged only by placing clear and unimpeachable material on record. (Para 66) Gross delay in approaching the High Court can constitute a material and decisive factor, which by itself can disentitled the writ petitioners to any sort of discretionary relief under Article 226. (Para 70)
National Green Tribunal Act - Section 14- Every question or dispute raised by an applicant before the Tribunal pertaining to the environment cannot be treated as a substantial question. It has to be a substantial question relating to environment as contemplated in Section 2(1)(m), and such substantial question must arise out of the implementation of any of the enactment/enactments specified in Schedule I. Though strict law of evidence may not be applicable to the cases filed before the Tribunal, the applicant has to raise the substantial question in his application specifically alleging the violation of a particular enactment specified in Schedule I. (Para 106)
Pogadadabnda Revathi v. State of Telangana; 2026 INSC 75 -CrPC/BNSS- Remand - Accused On Bail
Bail - When an accused is enlarged on bail, police custody cannot be granted so long as the order of bail continues to operate - Where the investigating agency seeks police remand of an accused who has already been enlarged on bail, the proper and legally permissible course is to first seek cancellation of bail in accordance with law and only thereafter apply for police custody. The scheme of criminal procedure does not countenance the grant of police remand of an accused who continues to enjoy the protection of bail, as such a course would effectively defeat and nullify the order granting bail.  (Para 17-19)
Union of India v. Heavy Vehicles Factory Employees’ Union 2026 INSC 74 - Factories Act
Factories Act, 1948: Section 59(2); Chapter VI (Sections 64, 65); Chapter XI (Sections 112, 113)- These sections do not empower the Central Government to issue any clarification or direction with reference to any provisions of the 1948 Act. None of the sections empowers the central government to even frame rules. The entire power is vested with the State Governments. All that the Central Government can do is, issue directions to the State Governments - when the statute provides for only two specific exclusions: bonus and wages for overtime work, in the absence of any formal rules governing the exclusion of other entitlements, the Executive cannot, through a mere Office Memorandum, read additional exclusions into the Act that the Legislature did not contemplate. (Para 15)
Interpretation of Statutes - Legislature never wastes its words. (Para 15) Different Ministries of the Government of India cannot assign different meaning to a provision in the Act of Parliament. (Para 14.1)
Neha Lal vs Abhishek Kumar; 2026 INSC 73; - Matrimonial Matters - Mediation - Irretrievable Breakdown Of Marriage
Matrimonial Matters - Warring couples cannot be allowed to settle their scores by treating Courts as their battlefield and choke the system. If there is no compatibility, there are modes available for early resolution of disputes. Process of mediation is the mode which can be explored at the stage of pre-litigation and even after litigation starts. When the parties start litigating against each other, especially on criminal side, the chances of reunion are remote but should not be ruled out. (Para 21) First and the foremost, earnest effort should be made by the parties and to be guided by the advocates, whensoever consulted in the process, is to convince them for a pre-litigation mediation. Rather in some cases, their counselling may be required - Even if a case is filed in a Court on a trivial issue such as maintenance under Section 144 of BNSS, 2023 (earlier Section 125 of CrPC, 1973) or Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the first effort required to be made by the Court is to explore mediation instead of calling upon the parties for filing replies as allegations and counter allegations sometimes aggravate the dispute. Even when a complaint is sought to be registered with the police of simple matrimonial dispute, first and the foremost effort has to be for re-conciliation, that too, if possible, through the mediation centers in the Courts, instead of calling the parties to the police stations. This sometimes becomes a point of no return specially when any of the parties is arrested, may it be even for a day. (Para 24) It is the duty of all concerned including the family members of the parties to make their earnest effort to resolve the disputes before any civil or criminal proceedings are launched.(Para 25)

Anil Daima v. State of Rajasthan 2026 INSC 72 - S.17A Prevention Of Corruption Act - Investigation By ACB
Prevention of Corruption Act 1988- Anti-Corruption Bureau of the State of Rajasthan has jurisdiction to register the criminal case under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act despite the fact that the accused is an employee of the Central Government- It is incorrect to say that it is only the CBI who could have instituted the prosecution. (Para 3)
Prevention of Corruption Act 1988- Section 17A - Cannot be applied to cases of demand of illegal gratification- Section 17-A talks about enquiry or inquiry or investigation of offences relatable to recommendations made or decision taken by public servant in discharge of official functions or duties. (Para 7)
Nawal Kishore Meena v. State of Rajasthan; 2026 INSC 71 - S.17 Prevention Of Corruption Act - Investigation By State Agencies
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: Sections 17 - Section 17 does not exclude or prevents the State Police or a Special Agency of the State from registering a crime or investigating cases relating to bribery, corruption and misconduct against Central Government employes- The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) is also a wing of State Police- The offences under the PC Act are also cognizable and can, therefore, be investigated by the State Police or VACB - The only rider is that the investigation can be done only by a police officer of the rank specified in Section 17 of the PC Act. (Para 8)
Criminal Investigation - The relation between the CBI and the State Police is supplementary to each other and as per the CBI constitution and inter se arrangement between CBI and State police there are several areas where the CBI and the Police require inter se cooperation and support. (Para 5)
Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 156 -The existence of a special law by itself cannot be taken to exclude the operation of Cr.P.C. Unless the special law expressly or impliedly provides a separate provision for investigation, the general provision under Section 156 of Cr.P.C shall prevail. (Para 6)
Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 2(s)- The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) is also a wing of State Police. (Para 8)
Viney Kumar Sharma v. Improvement Trust - Public Auction - Disclosure Of Litigation
Public Auction - Authorities (such as banks, recovery officers, or state bodies) conducting public auctions are legally required to disclose all known encumbrances and litigation relating to the property, as failure to do so invalidates the sale. Suppressing such material facts renders the auction fraudulent or vitiated by material irregularity -Public auction is one of the modes of sale intending to get highest competitive price for the property. Public auction also ensures fairness in actions of the public authorities and their officers who should act fairly and objectively. Their actions should be legitimate. Their dealing should be free from suspicion. Nothing should be suggestive of bias, favouritism, nepotism or beset with suspicious features of underbidding detrimental to the legitimate interest of the stakeholders.
State of Kerala vs Alankar Elite Inns and Hotels (P) Ltd.- Foreign Liquor Rules
Foreign Liquor Rules, 1953 - Rule 19 (iv) - The fee is leviable when permission is granted/ allowed- The law as it stands on the date when decision is taken to regularize/ permit/ allow a change, or reconstitution, would apply- No right accrued or crystallized in favour of the State to realize /impose fee on mere reconstitution of the Board- Fee become imposable only when reconstitution is permitted/ allowed. [Context: SC upheld Kerala High Court’s view that fees under the deleted second proviso to Rule 19(iv) of the Foreign Liquor Rules, 1953 could not be levied when regularization was granted after its omission. The Court held that the applicable law for fee imposition is the law in force on the date the change or reconstitution is allowed, not the date of the violation or board reconstitution. It left the interpretation of the Note appended to Rule 19 open for future cases and disposed of pending applications.]
Anubhuti Goel vs High Court of Uttarakhand - Judicial Service Exams
Judicial Service Exams -In this case, Uttarakhand Public Service Commission invited applications for Uttarakhand Civil Judge; petitioners applied, cleared prelim (30.04.2023), and sat mains (05–09.12.2023)- On 06.11.2023, Delhi High Court advertised DJS-2023; petitioners applied, got admit cards (12.12.2023), took prelim (17.12.2023), and later mains (13–14.04.2024) -On 06.05.2024, Uttarakhand results declared; petitioners selected. Govt notification issued (08.07.2024) approving appointments; High Court appointed them (11.07.2024) as Civil Judges with two-year probation -On 07.01.2025, DJS mains results published; petitioners shortlisted for viva scheduled 21.02.2025. They sought prior approval from Uttarakhand High Court on 05.02.2025- On 19.02.2025, Registrar General, Uttarakhand High Court rejected permission. The Supreme Court granted interim relief on 25.02.2025, enabling them to take the viva; they were successful- Now Supreme Court allowed the writ petition, directing cessation of their Uttarakhand service so they can join Delhi Judicial Service by 13.02.2026, and clarified seniority will follow merit, unaffected by joining delay.
Rambali Sahni v. State of Bihar - S.362 CrPC - Bail - Clerical Error
Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 362 - Bail - High Court recalled an order granting bail on the premise that Court Master though had recorded as petition having been rejected in the operative portion had mistakenly written as “allowed” -SC restored the bail order and observed: Once the judgment or order is signed, no alternation or review of the same is permissible except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error- There being no clerical or arithmetical error which had crept in, yet the High Court recalled the earlier order granted bail by impugned order and it was not justified in undertaking to recall the order.

Gujarat Public Service Commission v. Gnaneshwary Dushyantkumar Shah ., 2026 INSC 70 - AICTE Regulations - Recruitment Of Professors
All India Council for Technical Education (Career Advancement Scheme for the Teachers and Other Academic Staff in Technical Institutions) (Degree) Regulations, 2012 - Whether AICTE Regulations apply to the process of direct recruitment under the State Rules, conducted by the Commission, for filling up the post of Professors in Government Engineering Colleges in the State of Gujarat?- The person to whom the Regulations apply must already be an incumbent or a newly appointed Assistant Professor/Associate Professor or Professor. The Regulations are not Recruitment Rules but are Promotion and Progression Rules - To apply AICTE Regulations to a candidate participating in recruitment for the post of Professors in the Engineering Colleges in the State conducted by the Commission under State Rules framed by the State, would be to stretch the AICTE Regulations beyond its text, context, and purpose. The law does not permit a regulation crafted as a ladder to be used as a gate. Thus, the AICTE Regulations do not apply to the process of direct recruitment under the State Rules. (Para 13-15)
Public Employment - Selection - A candidate having participated in the process of selection, without protest, cannot challenge the Rules of the game after being declared unsuccessful. (Para 18)

Md. Firoz Mansuri v. State of Bihar 2026 INSC 68 - Bihar Pharmacist Cadre Rules - Constitutional Validity
Bihar Pharmacist Cadre Rules, 2014 (as amended in 2024) - Constitutional Validity Upheld - The prescription of eligibility criteria of 10+2 with Diploma in Pharmacy by the State cannot be said to be arbitrary or irrational- the decision of the State in making possession of a Diploma an essential qualification for appointment cannot be said to be arbitrary. The State has merely identified a narrower catchment of candidates it considers most suitable for a particular purpose, from within the larger pool registered pharmacists. (Para 62) There is no absolute exclusion of graduate or postgraduate degree holders. They remain eligible, provided they possess the essential qualification of Diploma in Pharmacy.(Para 64)
Pharmacy Act, 1948 - The Act creates a pool of persons eligible to practise as pharmacists, it does not mandate that every registered pharmacist must be considered for appointment to public posts. Its scope does not extend to conferring a right to public employment merely by virtue of registration - The Act only creates a pool of eligible persons who may be appointed as pharmacists. (Para 47-49)
Constitution of India - Article 226 - The power of judicial review in matters of recruitment is limited to examining legislative competence, arbitrariness or violation of fundamental rights, if any. Courts cannot rewrite service rules, determine equivalence of qualifications, or substitute their own assessment for that of the employer. The scope of judicial review in matters of public employment does not extend to questioning the State’s wisdom or policy in prescribing the minimum eligibility requirements for a public post. Qualifications are prescribed keeping in view the needs and interests of an institution, an industry or an establishment, as the case may be. Similarly, equivalence of a qualification is not a matter which can be determined in exercise of the power of judicial review. Whether a particular qualification should or should not be regarded as equivalent is a matter for the State, as the recruiting authority, to determine. The assessment of the expediency, advisability or utility of such prescription of qualifications do not warrant intervention of the Courts unless the same are shown to be perverse. However, at the same time, the employer cannot act arbitrarily in prescribing qualifications for posts. (Para 59)
Constitution of India - Article 309 - The power to frame rules under Article 309 of the Constitution of India empowers the State to determine the most suitable qualifications for public posts based on its independent assessment. (Para 50)
Education - A qualification in one stream does not presuppose a qualification in another. (Para 62)

Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 378 - Appeal against Acquittal - If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the Appellate Court should not disturb the findings of acquittal recorded by the Trial Court. Further, if the view taken is a possible view, the Appellate Court cannot overturn the order of acquittal on the ground that another view was also possible.- Principles Summarized: (a) whether the judgment of acquittal suffers from patent perversity; (b) whether the judgment is based on misreading/omission to consider the material evidence on record; (c) an order of acquittal is to be interfered with only when there are “compelling and substantial reasons” for doing so. If the order is “clearly unreasonable”, it is a compelling reason for interference.’ (d) the appellate court, while deciding an appeal against acquittal, after reappreciating the evidence, is required to consider whether the view taken by the trial court is a possible view which could have been taken on the basis of the evidence on record; (e) if the view taken is a possible view, the appellate court cannot overturn the order of acquittal on the ground that another view was also possible; and (f) the appellate court can interfere with the order of acquittal only if it comes to a finding that the only conclusion which can be recorded on the basis of the evidence on record was that the guilt of the accused was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and no other conclusion was possible.

HT Media Limited v. Principal Commissioner Delhi South Goods and Service Tax; 2026 INSC 66 - Taxation -Event Management Contracts
Interpretation of Statutes - Taxing Statute - The principle of strict interpretation of a taxing statute, particularly in the context of charging provisions - In construing fiscal statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax one must have regard to the strict letter of law. If the revenue satisfies the court that the case falls strictly within the provisions of the law, the subject can be taxed. If, on the other hand, the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxing statute, no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter.
Finance Act, 1994 - Event Management Contracts - The expressions ‘event management’ and ‘event managers’ is commonly understood in the sense of appointing someone to manage or organize the event. Individual contract for booking of persons required for participation in the event are not commonly understood as “event management” contracts. (Para 48)

X v. O/O Speaker of the House of People 2026 INSC 65 - Judges Inquiry Act - Writ Jurisdiction
Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 - Section 3(2) Proviso 1 - In a case where notices of motion were given in both Houses on the same day, the fact that a notice is not admitted in one House will not necessitate constitution of a Joint Committee and the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, can independently proceed to constitute a Committee- There is nothing in the Inquiry Act to suggest that rejection of a motion in one House would render the other House incompetent to proceed in accordance with law- It does not contemplate a scenario where a notice of motion is accepted in one House and rejected in the other. The proviso applies to only one specific situation, namely, where notices of motion given on the same day have been admitted by both Houses. It does not restrict or negate the individual authority of either House of Parliament. (Para 12-14) Role of the Secretary General -Where no prescribed format exists, a notice containing allegations of impropriety against a Judge could not reasonably be treated as ineffective solely on account of perceived deficiencies in drafting or form. The role of the Secretary General was confined to placing the notice before the competent authority, namely, the office of the Chairman, without expressing any conclusion as to its admissibility. (Para 50)
Constitution of India - Article 124 - The process of removal of a Judge is indeed a tedious one involving various stages - Discussed (Para 1-6)
Constitution of India - Article 226 - Writ jurisdiction is exercised to test the legality of an existing order, and not to grant relief on the hypothesis that another authority ought to have acted differently- The settled limits of writ jurisdiction do not permit the Court to confer relief in vacuum, divorced from a direct challenge to the order which is alleged to be the source of illegality. (Para 45) If an order has been passed to the prejudice or detriment of a suitor and such suitor seeks to have the order declared invalid and quashed in writ proceedings, it is imperative that he lays the order to a challenge, makes specific averments and urges cogent legal grounds to demonstrate its invalidity to enable him claim relief based thereon. (Para 40)
Constitution of India - Article 32- The extraordinary remedy under Article 32 is confined to enforcement of Fundamental Rights and does not extend to issuing advisory or corrective directions in relation to internal statutory mechanisms of the Parliament, where no present or inevitable infraction of any Fundamental Right is evinced. (Para 55)
Interpretation of Statutes - To read the statute in isolation of the Constitution would be grossly incorrect. Any interpretation of a statute which has the effect of generating an interpretation fouling the Constitution should be eschewed. (Para 17.2-4) -Proviso: A proviso cannot be read in a way which nullifies the provision to which it is a proviso , unless such an intention is manifest. (Para 12.4)
Disciplinary Proceedings - Every infraction of the rules governing discipline and control does not, by itself, vitiate disciplinary proceedings. A plea founded on infraction of procedure must necessarily be examined through the prism of prejudice, having regard to the nature of the rule alleged to have been infracted, namely, whether it is mandatory or merely directory. Such an enquiry presupposes the existence of infraction of a governing rule. (Para 34)

State of Haryana v. Krishan Kumar & Ors.; 2026 INSC 63 - Drug Rules - Inspectors Appointment
Drug Rules, 1945 -State made Rules cannot be construed so as to invalidate or prevail over the central Drug Rules (Para 44)- The rules framed by the State Government by adding experience in addition to the qualification prescribed by the Drugs Rules cannot be made applicable for their appointment as Inspectors. (Para 50)
Legal Maxim - Expressio unius est exclusio alterius’ means the “express mention of one thing excludes others.”  [Context: SC held that once the Centre has consciously and expressly occupied the field by placing the Drug Rules framed 55 under the D&C Act before both Houses of the Parliament as provided under Section 38, any inconsistent exercise of power by the State, even under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, stands impliedly excluded. ]

Authority for Advance Rulings (Income Tax) v. Tiger Global International II/III/IV Holdings; 2026 INSC 60 - Taxation - GAAR
General Anti-Avoidance Rule- The prescription of the cut-off date of investment under Rule 10U(1)(d) stands diluted by Rule 10U(2), if any tax benefit is obtained based on such arrangement. The duration of the arrangement is irrelevant. (Para 46)
International Law - Taxation - It is a fundamental rule of international taxation that every nation has a sovereign right to impose tax on the global income of its residents and on income that accrues or arises within its territorial limits. These twin rights are referred to as residence-based or source-based taxation - Tax Treaty - Treaty provisions are expressions of sovereign policy of more than one sovereign State, negotiated and entered into at a political/diplomatic level and having several explicit and/or subliminal and unarticulated considerations as their bases. A tax treaty must be seen in the context of aiding commercial relations between treaty partners and as being essentially a bargain between Contracting States as to the division of tax revenues between them in respect of income falling to be taxed in both jurisdictions. (Para 38-39)
Taxation - Tax Planning - Tax Evasion - Though it is permissible in law for an assessee to plan his transaction so as to avoid the levy of tax, the mechanism must be permissible and in conformity with the parameters contemplated under the provisions of the Act, rules, or notifications. Once the mechanism is found to be illegal or sham, it ceases to be “a permissible avoidance” and becomes “an impermissible avoidance” or “evasion” (Para 49)
Legislation -Parliament is well within its right to bring in a law, either by amendment, substitution, or introduction so as to remove the basis of a judicial decision. (Para 27)
Circulars - Circulars though binding on the Revenue at the time of their issuance, operate only within the legal regime in which they were issued and cannot override subsequent statutory amendments. (Para 27)

Riar Builders Pvt Ltd v. Union of India -National Highways Act - Compensation Of Land Owners
National Highways Act, 1956 - The remedy provided to an expropriated land owner/interested party, if such person is aggrieved by the rate of compensation determined by the competent Authority, is to invoke arbitration under Section 3G(5) read with provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act - Land owners, whose land is acquired under the 1956 Act, vis-à-vis the land owners whose lands are acquired now under the New Act, have been treated as separate classes, apparently without any intelligible differentia- While there seems to be a lot of legislative wisdom discernible from the mechanism encapsulated under the 1956 Act, to the effect that the acquisition under this Act must take place in a time-bound and expeditious manner so that the development of National Highways is not hampered or delayed. Though such a legislative policy is laudable, prima facie, it seems that this object can be kept intact while ensuring the land owners that they will be entitled to assessment of compensation for the acquired land in the same manner as is determined for the land owners whose lands are acquired under the Old Act or under the New Act, even when such acquisition is also for infrastructural development - Suggestion: Union of India should revisit the legislative scheme and consider the desirability of bringing parity in the matter of providing a mechanism for the determination of the market value of acquired land with reference to Article 300-A of the Constitution of India. (Para 5-11)

Municipal Council, Nandyal v. K. Jayaram - Public Employment - Regular and Contractual - Distinction
Public Employment - Regular and Contractual - Distinction - Employment under a State entity is a public asset and every citizen of the country has a right to apply for it. In a regular employment, directly made by the said State entity, there are safeguards to ensure that the system of employment/engagement is transparent and fulfills a minimum criteria and is open to all eligible persons and a mode/procedure is adopted for ultimately choosing the right person. When employees/workmen are taken through a contractor, it is the absolute discretion of the contractor as to whom and through which mode he would choose such persons to be sent to the principal- If the persons who are employed through a contractor, and have come to work, are given equal benefit and status as a regular employee, it would amount to giving premium and sanction to a process which is totally arbitrary as there is no mode prescribed in any contract as to how the contractor would employ or choose the persons who are to be sent, except for the basic qualification, i.e., knowledge in the field for which they are required.

In the event of appeal or revision being dismissed the consequences would automatically follow and the jurisdictional magistrate would be fully empowered to secure the presence of such accused in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

Keshaw Mahto v. State of Bihar - SC-ST Act - Element Of Humiliation
Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989: Sections 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s) - Even mere knowledge of the fact that the complainant is a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe is not sufficient to attract Section 3(1)(r) - Merely abusing a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe would not be enough- Saying caste name would also not constitute an offence-To constitute an offence under Section 3(1)(s) it would be necessary that the accused abuses a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe “by the caste name” in any place within public view. Thus, the allegations must reveal that abuses were laced with caste name, or the caste name had been hurled as an abuse- The element of humiliation is present in Section 3(1)(s) as well. It has to be gathered from the intentional insult towards the caste, and the content. The content under Section 3(1)(s) are the abuses hurled at a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe. However, the intent with which the abuses were hurled must be found to be denigrating towards the caste, resulting into a feeling of caste-based humiliation. (Para 12-18)

Alagu v. State of Tamil Nadu -Preventive Detention - Grounds
Preventive Detention - Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Slum Grabbers Act, 1982 - Grant of bail to some other person in some other case cannot be a ground to believe that the detenue, who is involved in some other case, is likely to be released on bail. [Context: While ordering release of a detenue, SC observed: the bail prayer of the detenue had already been rejected by the Court of Session and there was no fresh bail application filed by the detenue. Further, there is nothing on record to indicate that co-accused of the case in which the appellant was under judicial custody was admitted to bail on the date the detention order was passed. Detaining authority though, in the Grounds of detention referred to some other person being admitted to bail in some other case, did not disclose the facts of that case to demonstrate that it was so similar that a reasonable satisfaction could be drawn that detenue is likely to benefit from it and be released on bail.

Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 - Section 3(2) Proviso 1 - In a case where notices of motion were given in both Houses on the same day, the fact that a notice is not admitted in one House will not necessitate constitution of a Joint Committee and the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, can independently proceed to constitute a Committee- There is nothing in the Inquiry Act to suggest that rejection of a motion in one House would render the other House incompetent to proceed in accordance with law- It does not contemplate a scenario where a notice of motion is accepted in one House and rejected in the other. The proviso applies to only one specific situation, namely, where notices of motion given on the same day have been admitted by both Houses. It does not restrict or negate the individual authority of either House of Parliament. (Para 12-14) Role of the Secretary General -Where no prescribed format exists, a notice containing allegations of impropriety against a Judge could not reasonably be treated as ineffective solely on account of perceived deficiencies in drafting or form. The role of the Secretary General was confined to placing the notice before the competent authority, namely, the office of the Chairman, without expressing any conclusion as to its admissibility. (Para 50)
Constitution of India - Article 124 - The process of removal of a Judge is indeed a tedious one involving various stages - Discussed (Para 1-6)
Constitution of India - Article 226 - Writ jurisdiction is exercised to test the legality of an existing order, and not to grant relief on the hypothesis that another authority ought to have acted differently- The settled limits of writ jurisdiction do not permit the Court to confer relief in vacuum, divorced from a direct challenge to the order which is alleged to be the source of illegality. (Para 45) If an order has been passed to the prejudice or detriment of a suitor and such suitor seeks to have the order declared invalid and quashed in writ proceedings, it is imperative that he lays the order to a challenge, makes specific averments and urges cogent legal grounds to demonstrate its invalidity to enable him claim relief based thereon. (Para 40)
Constitution of India - Article 32- The extraordinary remedy under Article 32 is confined to enforcement of Fundamental Rights and does not extend to issuing advisory or corrective directions in relation to internal statutory mechanisms of the Parliament, where no present or inevitable infraction of any Fundamental Right is evinced. (Para 55)
Interpretation of Statutes - To read the statute in isolation of the Constitution would be grossly incorrect. Any interpretation of a statute which has the effect of generating an interpretation fouling the Constitution should be eschewed. (Para 17.2-4) -Proviso: A proviso cannot be read in a way which nullifies the provision to which it is a proviso , unless such an intention is manifest. (Para 12.4)
Disciplinary Proceedings - Every infraction of the rules governing discipline and control does not, by itself, vitiate disciplinary proceedings. A plea founded on infraction of procedure must necessarily be examined through the prism of prejudice, having regard to the nature of the rule alleged to have been infracted, namely, whether it is mandatory or merely directory. Such an enquiry presupposes the existence of infraction of a governing rule. (Para 34)

Rajasthan Public Service Commission v. Yati Jain ; 2026 INSC 64 - Waiting List - Writ Appeal -LPA
Service Law - Waiting List - The key aspects of a waiting list, in relation to service law disputes: (i) a waiting list is normally prepared after the select/merit list is drawn; (ii) it would include candidates who have qualified the recruitment examination but are not so meritorious such that they can be immediately appointed on the number of vacancies advertised; (iii) such list would operate like a merit-based queue for vacancies that remain unfilled after offers of appointment given to the candidates in the select/merit list are not accepted; (iv) a waiting list has a limited validity period; (v) validity period of a waiting list depends on the recruitment rules and should no such period be mentioned, it can bona fide be operated till the next advertisement is issued without, however, violating provisions in such rules, if any, requiring recruitment process to be initiated either semi-annually or annually; and (vi) an opportunity to a candidate in the waiting list for securing appointment arises only when vacancies remain unfilled after the process of appointing candidates from the select/merit list is over and hence, it is regarded as a procedural outcome which is part of a structured process rather than a fortuitous circumstance- A wait-listed candidate has no right of appointment, much less an indefeasible right, except when the governing recruitment rules permit a small window authorizing appointments therefrom in the specified exceptional circumstances and the appointing authority, for no good reason, denies or refuses an appointment or the reason assigned therefor is found to be arbitrary and/or discriminatory and that too, when the waiting list has not expired.  (Para 86-90)
Constitution of India - Article 226 -Intra Court Jurisdiction - Letters patent appeal - A letters patent appeal, as permitted under the Letters Patent, is normally an intra-court appeal whereunder the Letters Patent Bench, sitting as a “Court of Correction”, corrects its own orders in exercise of the same jurisdiction as was vested in the Single Bench: Exercise of intra-court appellate jurisdiction could be called for if the judgment/order under challenge is palpably erroneous or suffers from perversity; but, it may not be exercised when two views are possible on a given set of facts and one of two views has been taken which is a plausible view.  (Para 50-51) “Person aggrieved”: A writ appeal is a continuation of the original writ petition - anyone who may file a writ petition would have the locus standi to file a writ appeal albeit with some caveats: A person aggrieved having locus standi to prefer an appeal would be one who is directly affected or impacted by a judgment, order or decision even though the same does not directly require him to do something, or, one, who being a party to a suit, is adversely affected by the decree. To file an appeal, such a person typically needs to show affectation of a legal right or interest, or that he is likely to suffer a legal wrong as a result of its impact. A mere interest or concern in the subject matter decided by the original court would not be enough - the conditions that need to be satisfied before a person is entitled to maintain an appeal. These are: 1) that the appealing party has been a party in the proceedings from which the appeal has arisen; 2) that the definitive and conclusive ruling of the High Court on the rights of the parties in dispute is the subject of the appeal; and 3) that he is a ‘person aggrieved’, that is, a party who has been adversely affected by the determination.  Condition (1) supra may, however, stand relaxed in given cases (Para 50- 67)
Appeal -An appeal is always a creature of statute - The right of appeal is the right of reaching out to a superior court, invoking its authority to have a relook at the facts vis-àvis the law applicable and to rectify the errors committed by a court inferior in the hierarchy. It is a very valuable right. Therefore, when the statute confers such a right of appeal, it is open to the person aggrieved to seek correction of the errors committed by the inferior court. (Para 45-46)
Public Service Commission - Although the recommendations made by a Public Service Commission are not binding and hence, may or may not be accepted by the Government of the State, one thing is clear: the latter has no authority to appoint anyone not recommended by the former. (Para 73)
Executive instructions  - executive instructions may supplement, but not supplant, statutory rules and should be subservient to statutory provisions.
Constitution of India - Article 14,226 - Perpetuation of illegality ought to be shunned by any Court of law. This forms the basis for denying the plea of negative equality -The illegality in recommending some of the candidates figuring in the reserve list could not have been made the basis for issuance of a writ of mandamus citing Article 14 of the Constitution.  (Para 101-102)
Constitution of India - Article 226 - Service Disputes - A substantial number of service-related disputes pending across the country are aggravated by protracted and recurring litigation, resulting in a state of perpetual flux for many candidates across the country. The judiciary would do well to remain circumspect of these practical realities, and interpret service rules in a manner that furthers the very object of a selection process, that is, the selection of the most suitable candidates from suitable candidates for appointment in a timely manner. (Para 123)
Summary: Appeal by the Rajasthan Public Service Commission against High Court orders that had directed the appointment of candidates from a reserve list after several originally selected individuals failed to join their posts - Allowing appeal, SC held  that the Commission had the locus standi to appeal as a constitutional body ; wait-listed candidates possess no indefeasible right to appointment, particularly once the statutory validity period of the list has lapsed; the six-month validity of a reserve list under the relevant rules must be strictly calculated from the date the original list was forwarded rather than from the date a vacancy later arose due to non-joining.

State of Haryana v. Krishan Kumar & Ors.; 2026 INSC 63 - Drug Rules - Inspectors Appointment
Drug Rules, 1945 -State made Rules cannot be construed so as to invalidate or prevail over the central Drug Rules (Para 44)- The rules framed by the State Government by adding experience in addition to the qualification prescribed by the Drugs Rules cannot be made applicable for their appointment as Inspectors. (Para 50)
Legal Maxim - Expressio unius est exclusio alterius’ means the “express mention of one thing excludes others.”  [Context: SC held that once the Centre has consciously and expressly occupied the field by placing the Drug Rules framed 55 under the D&C Act before both Houses of the Parliament as provided under Section 38, any inconsistent exercise of power by the State, even under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, stands impliedly excluded. ]

Amit Kumar v. Union of India 2026 INSC 62 - Higher Educational Institutions - Student Suicides - Directions Issued
Higher Educational Institutions - Student Suicides - The Supreme Court, acknowledging a surge in student suicides, reviewed an interim report from a National Task Force that identified systemic stressors in Higher Educational Institutions—ranging from inadequate support systems, ragging, academic pressure, financial delays, and poor mental health services—to fragmented implementation of existing policies. Exercising Article 142, the Court issued directions including mandatory police reporting of any student suicide or unnatural death, annual reporting to regulators, filling faculty and leadership vacancies within four months, clearing scholarship backlogs promptly, ensuring round-the-clock medical access, and strict compliance with UGC regulations on equity, anti‑ragging, sexual harassment, and grievance redressal. The Court also asked the Task Force to develop model SOPs for wellbeing audits, faculty training, and campus mental health services, aiming for a unified, enforceable student well‑being framework.

Specific Relief Act, 1963 - Section 41 - When there is a cloud over possession of the disputed property, the suit for injunction simpliciter is not maintainable - The appropriate and efficacious remedy available is to institute a suit for possession along with a consequential relief of injunction, and not a suit for injunction simpliciter - When there is no cloud over title or possession, or where the defendant’s occupation flows from a licence or permissive arrangement, a suit for mandatory injunction is maintainable as the most efficacious remedy - The expression “equally efficacious remedy” denotes a remedy which would place the Plaintiffs in the same position in which he would have been had the relief of injunction not been sought. (Para 16-23)

Authority for Advance Rulings (Income Tax) v. Tiger Global International II/III/IV Holdings; 2026 INSC 60 - Taxation - GAAR
General Anti-Avoidance Rule- The prescription of the cut-off date of investment under Rule 10U(1)(d) stands diluted by Rule 10U(2), if any tax benefit is obtained based on such arrangement. The duration of the arrangement is irrelevant. (Para 46)
International Law - Taxation - It is a fundamental rule of international taxation that every nation has a sovereign right to impose tax on the global income of its residents and on income that accrues or arises within its territorial limits. These twin rights are referred to as residence-based or source-based taxation - Tax Treaty - Treaty provisions are expressions of sovereign policy of more than one sovereign State, negotiated and entered into at a political/diplomatic level and having several explicit and/or subliminal and unarticulated considerations as their bases. A tax treaty must be seen in the context of aiding commercial relations between treaty partners and as being essentially a bargain between Contracting States as to the division of tax revenues between them in respect of income falling to be taxed in both jurisdictions. (Para 38-39)
Taxation - Tax Planning - Tax Evasion - Though it is permissible in law for an assessee to plan his transaction so as to avoid the levy of tax, the mechanism must be permissible and in conformity with the parameters contemplated under the provisions of the Act, rules, or notifications. Once the mechanism is found to be illegal or sham, it ceases to be “a permissible avoidance” and becomes “an impermissible avoidance” or “evasion” (Para 49)
Legislation -Parliament is well within its right to bring in a law, either by amendment, substitution, or introduction so as to remove the basis of a judicial decision. (Para 27)
Circulars - Circulars though binding on the Revenue at the time of their issuance, operate only within the legal regime in which they were issued and cannot override subsequent statutory amendments. (Para 27)

Vayyaeti Srinivasarao v. Gaineedi Jagajyothi; 2026 INSC 59 - Transfer of Property Act - Stamp Act
Transfer of Property Act 1882- Section 54 - A contract for sale (agreement to sell) would not confer any title nor transfer any interest in an immovable property (except to the limited right granted under Section 53A of the Act). Thus, an agreement to sell or a contract for sale with or without possession is not a conveyance deed. Therefore, a sale of immovable property can only be made by a registered instrument and that an agreement of sale does not create any interest or charge on its subject matter. (Para 5.10)
Transfer of Property Act 1882- Section 53A- Section 53A applies to a person who contracts to transfer immovable property in writing. If the proposed transferee in the agreement has taken possession of the property or he continues in possession thereof being already in possession in part 26 performance of the contract and has done some act in furtherance of the contract and transferee has performed or is willing to perform his part of the contract, the transferor shall be debarred from enforcing any right in respect of the property- In a case where a person claims benefit of part performance, evidence that he was inducted into possession for the first time subsequent to the contract, would be a strong piece of evidence regarding the contract and of possession changing hands pursuant to the contract. Continuous possession of a tenant in the suit property even after entering into the sale agreements would not by itself amount to a part-performance, putting the tenant in possession of the suit properties pursuant to the sale agreements. (Para 5.12-13)
Transfer of Property Act 1882- Section 111 - Distinction between an express and implied surrender - While express surrender is a matter of intention of the parties, implied surrender is by implication of the law. An implied surrender is the act of the law and takes place independently of and in some cases even in spite of the intention of the parties. (Para 5.7)

Elegna Co-Op Housing & Commercial Society Ltd v. Edelweiss ARC Ltd, 2026 INSC 58. - S.7 IBC - Homebuyer Society Locus
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 - Section 7- The right to initiate or participate in insolvency proceedings is statutory, not equitable - A society or Resident Welfare Association, not being a creditor in its own right and not recognised as an authorised representative of allottees under the IBC, has no locus standi to intervene in proceedings arising out a Section 7 petition (Para 13.22)- Proceedings under Section 7 are essentially bipartite at the admission stage, involving only the financial creditor and the corporate debtor. Unrelated third parties including other creditors, have no independent right of audience at this stage.(Para 13.11) At the pre-admission stage, proceedings under Section 7 remain in personam, and neither the Adjudicating Authority nor the Appellate Authority is required to hear other creditors, much less unrelated third parties. When proceedings are in personam, no right of audience inheres in persons who are strangers to the debt and default forming the basis of the application. (Para 13.5)
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 - Section 30- If the CoC approves a resolution plan in derogation of the objectives, scheme, and ethos of the Code, the NCLT is not rendered powerless at the stage of approval (Para 12.17)- While the commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors is paramount and is not ordinarily amenable to judicial review, the width of powers vested in the CoC carries with it a corresponding duty of responsibility. Any extraordinary or non-routine decision taken by the CoC must be supported by cogent reasons duly recorded in writing. (Para 15.1)

State of Himachal Pradesh vs Chaman Lal; 2026 INSC 57 - Evidence Act - Dying Declaration - Appeal Against Acquittal - Hostile Witness - Motive
Indian Evidence Act 1872 - Section 32 - A dying declaration need not be made in expectation of immediate death; that a conviction under Section 302 IPC can rest solely on a dying declaration if it is found to be voluntary, truthful and reliable; and that corroboration is not a rule of law but one of prudence. (Para 16) - The law does not prescribe any rigid form for recording a dying declaration. So long as the Court is satisfied that the declaration is voluntary, truthful and reliable, hyper-technical objections cannot form the basis for its rejection. (Para 18.3) No absolute proposition that a dying declaration must invariably be discarded in the absence of corroboration. Each case must necessarily turn on its own facts. (Para 25)
Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 378,386- Where a judgment of acquittal is found to be manifestly erroneous, perverse, or founded on a misreading of evidence or incorrect application of law, this Court would be justified to set aside the acquittal and record a conviction, albeit exercising such power with circumspection and in exceptional circumstances. (Para 13)
Criminal Trial - Hostile Witness -The testimony of a hostile witness can be relied upon only to the extent it is corroborated by other reliable evidence. (Para 20) 
Motive- Motive assumes significance, primarily in cases based on circumstantial evidence. Where there is direct evidence in the form of a credible and trustworthy dying declaration, the absence of strong proof of motive is not fatal to the prosecution case. (Para 23)

Constitution of India - Article 226 - In a writ petition, which is decided on affidavits, the burden of establishing the existence of the facts asserted squarely lies upon the writ petitioner, and such burden can be discharged only by placing clear and unimpeachable material on record. (Para 66) Gross delay in approaching the High Court can constitute a material and decisive factor, which by itself can disentitled the writ petitioners to any sort of discretionary relief under Article 226.

Prakash Atlanta (JV) v. NHAI; 2026 INSC 76 - S.34 Arbitration Act - BOCW Act- Cess Act
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Section 34 - If an arbitral tribunal’s view is found to be a possible and plausible one, it cannot be substituted merely because an alternate view is possible. Construction and interpretation of a contract and its terms is a matter for the arbitral tribunal to determine. Unless the same is found to be one that no fair-minded or reasonable person would arrive at, it cannot be interfered with. If there are two plausible interpretations of the terms of a contract, then no fault can be found if the arbitrator accepts one such interpretation as against the other. To be in conflict with the public policy of India, the award must contravene the fundamental policy of Indian law, which makes it narrower in its application. (Para 59)
Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 - Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Cess Act, 1996 - Cess Act along with the Rules framed thereunder became operative in the whole of the NCT of Delhi from January, 2002 - The BOCW Act and the Cess Act were brought into force on the dates notified therein but could not have been given effect to till Welfare Boards were constituted under Section 18 of the BOCW Act. Notwithstanding the dates from which these two enactments were brought into force, the BOCW Act and the Cess Act remained dormant, in fact, owing to the failure of the appropriate Governments in taking necessary measures to bring the provisions thereof into actual effect -The Cess Act is complementary to the BOCW Act and was enacted for augmenting the resources of the Welfare Boards, constituted under Section 18 of the BOCW Act. Therefore, in the absence of such Welfare Boards, levy and collection of cess under the Cess Act did not arise, given the scheme and structure of the two Acts and the Rules - constitution of Welfare Boards was essential and was a condition precedent for levy and collection of the cess in relation to the BOCW Act and the Cess Act. The registration of workers or providing of welfare measures to them, however, are not pre-conditions for the levy and collection of such cess. (Para 59)

Pogadadabnda Revathi v. State of Telangana; 2026 INSC 75 -CrPC/BNSS- Remand - Accused On Bail
Bail - When an accused is enlarged on bail, police custody cannot be granted so long as the order of bail continues to operate - Where the investigating agency seeks police remand of an accused who has already been enlarged on bail, the proper and legally permissible course is to first seek cancellation of bail in accordance with law and only thereafter apply for police custody. The scheme of criminal procedure does not countenance the grant of police remand of an accused who continues to enjoy the protection of bail, as such a course would effectively defeat and nullify the order granting bail.  (Para 17-19)

Union of India v. Heavy Vehicles Factory Employees’ Union 2026 INSC 74 - Factories Act
Factories Act, 1948: Section 59(2); Chapter VI (Sections 64, 65); Chapter XI (Sections 112, 113)- These sections do not empower the Central Government to issue any clarification or direction with reference to any provisions of the 1948 Act. None of the sections empowers the central government to even frame rules. The entire power is vested with the State Governments. All that the Central Government can do is, issue directions to the State Governments - when the statute provides for only two specific exclusions: bonus and wages for overtime work, in the absence of any formal rules governing the exclusion of other entitlements, the Executive cannot, through a mere Office Memorandum, read additional exclusions into the Act that the Legislature did not contemplate. (Para 15)
Interpretation of Statutes - Legislature never wastes its words. (Para 15) Different Ministries of the Government of India cannot assign different meaning to a provision in the Act of Parliament. (Para 14.1)

Neha Lal vs Abhishek Kumar; 2026 INSC 73; - Matrimonial Matters - Mediation - Irretrievable Breakdown Of Marriage
Matrimonial Matters - Warring couples cannot be allowed to settle their scores by treating Courts as their battlefield and choke the system. If there is no compatibility, there are modes available for early resolution of disputes. Process of mediation is the mode which can be explored at the stage of pre-litigation and even after litigation starts. When the parties start litigating against each other, especially on criminal side, the chances of reunion are remote but should not be ruled out. (Para 21) First and the foremost, earnest effort should be made by the parties and to be guided by the advocates, whensoever consulted in the process, is to convince them for a pre-litigation mediation. Rather in some cases, their counselling may be required - Even if a case is filed in a Court on a trivial issue such as maintenance under Section 144 of BNSS, 2023 (earlier Section 125 of CrPC, 1973) or Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the first effort required to be made by the Court is to explore mediation instead of calling upon the parties for filing replies as allegations and counter allegations sometimes aggravate the dispute. Even when a complaint is sought to be registered with the police of simple matrimonial dispute, first and the foremost effort has to be for re-conciliation, that too, if possible, through the mediation centers in the Courts, instead of calling the parties to the police stations. This sometimes becomes a point of no return specially when any of the parties is arrested, may it be even for a day. (Para 24) It is the duty of all concerned including the family members of the parties to make their earnest effort to resolve the disputes before any civil or criminal proceedings are launched.(Para 25)
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 - Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage -Under the, this is not a ground on which divorce can be sought or granted.(Para 10)
Constitution of India - Article 142 - Supreme Court can dissolve the marriage on account of irretrievable breakdown - Multiple court cases between the parties and repeated failure in mediation are testimony of marriage being broken down. (Para 11-13)

(Para 3)
Prevention of Corruption Act 1988- Section 17A - Cannot be applied to cases of demand of illegal gratification- Section 17-A talks about enquiry or inquiry or investigation of offences relatable to recommendations made or decision taken by public servant in discharge of official functions or duties.

Nawal Kishore Meena v. State of Rajasthan; 2026 INSC 71 - S.17 Prevention Of Corruption Act - Investigation By State Agencies
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: Sections 17 - Section 17 does not exclude or prevents the State Police or a Special Agency of the State from registering a crime or investigating cases relating to bribery, corruption and misconduct against Central Government employes- The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) is also a wing of State Police- The offences under the PC Act are also cognizable and can, therefore, be investigated by the State Police or VACB - The only rider is that the investigation can be done only by a police officer of the rank specified in Section 17 of the PC Act. (Para 8)
Criminal Investigation - The relation between the CBI and the State Police is supplementary to each other and as per the CBI constitution and inter se arrangement between CBI and State police there are several areas where the CBI and the Police require inter se cooperation and support. (Para 5)
Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 156 -The existence of a special law by itself cannot be taken to exclude the operation of Cr.P.C. Unless the special law expressly or impliedly provides a separate provision for investigation, the general provision under Section 156 of Cr.P.C shall prevail. (Para 6)
Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 2(s)- The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) is also a wing of State Police. (Para 8)

Viney Kumar Sharma v. Improvement Trust - Public Auction - Disclosure Of Litigation
Public Auction - Authorities (such as banks, recovery officers, or state bodies) conducting public auctions are legally required to disclose all known encumbrances and litigation relating to the property, as failure to do so invalidates the sale. Suppressing such material facts renders the auction fraudulent or vitiated by material irregularity -Public auction is one of the modes of sale intending to get highest competitive price for the property. Public auction also ensures fairness in actions of the public authorities and their officers who should act fairly and objectively. Their actions should be legitimate. Their dealing should be free from suspicion. Nothing should be suggestive of bias, favouritism, nepotism or beset with suspicious features of underbidding detrimental to the legitimate interest of the stakeholders.

State of Kerala vs Alankar Elite Inns and Hotels (P) Ltd.- Foreign Liquor Rules
Foreign Liquor Rules, 1953 - Rule 19 (iv) - The fee is leviable when permission is granted/ allowed- The law as it stands on the date when decision is taken to regularize/ permit/ allow a change, or reconstitution, would apply- No right accrued or crystallized in favour of the State to realize /impose fee on mere reconstitution of the Board- Fee become imposable only when reconstitution is permitted/ allowed. [Context: SC upheld Kerala High Court’s view that fees under the deleted second proviso to Rule 19(iv) of the Foreign Liquor Rules, 1953 could not be levied when regularization was granted after its omission. The Court held that the applicable law for fee imposition is the law in force on the date the change or reconstitution is allowed, not the date of the violation or board reconstitution. It left the interpretation of the Note appended to Rule 19 open for future cases and disposed of pending applications.]

Hemalatha (D) v. Tukaram (D) 2026 INSC 82 - Registered Sale Deed - Declaration As Sham Document - Presumption About Validity & Genuineness
Specific Relief Act 1963 - Section 34 - Declaration Suit - Registered Sale Deed -Strong presumption about the validity and genuineness- A Court must not lightly or casually declare a registered instrument as a “sham” - The burden of proof to displace this presumption rests heavily upon the challenger. Such a challenge can only be sustained if the party provides material particulars and cogent evidence to demonstrate that the Deed was never intended to operate as a bona fide transfer of title - The grounds typically accepted to challenge a registered Deed at the instance of the vendee/executant are fraud or want of capacity in any party or mistake of fact or fundamental illegality like where the Deed was executed under deceit or sold by a fraudster who did not own the land or where the Deed was executed without consideration, namely, if no money or value was actually exchanged despite recitals in the Deeds or where there was coercion or intimidation like where the seller was forced to sign without free consent. (Para 31-32) 
Pleading Standards - Code of Civil Procedure - Order VI Rule 4 - The person alleging that a registered Deed is a sham must satisfy a rigorous standard of pleading by making clear, cogent, convincing averments and provide material particulars in his pleadings and evidence. This Court is of the view that the test akin to a test under Order VI Rule 4 CPC is applicable to such a pleading and clever drafting creating illusion of cause of action would not be permitted and a clear right to sue would have to be shown in the plaint. (Para 34)
Registration - Registered documents must inspire certainty; they cannot be rendered precarious by frivolous litigation- caution against the growing tendency to challenge registered instruments ‘at the drop of a hat'. (Para 33)
Indian Evidence Act, 1872 - Section 91,92 -Mere suspicion or nebulous averments without material particulars would not be sufficient to dislodge the presumption under Sections 91 and 92. (Para 35)
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - Section 58- The condition precedent for arriving at a finding that the transaction involves mortgage by way of conditional sale is that there must be an ostensible sale and the condition that on default of payment of mortgage money on a certain date, the sale shall become absolute or on condition that on such payment being made the sale shall become void, or on condition that on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller shall be embodied in the same document-A deeming fiction was added in the negative that a transaction shall not be deemed to be a mortgage unless the condition for reconveyance is contained in the document which purports to effect the sale. (Para 48-49)
Indian Contract Act, 1872 - Section 25 - Mere allegation of inadequacy of consideration does not make the Deed void. It is only in the absence of sale consideration being tendered that the sale deed would be void. (Para 60)
Revenue Entries - Revenue entries in the municipal records do not prove ownership. (Para 63)
Registration - Reforms - Urgent need for the digitization of registered documents and land records using secure, tamper-proof technologies such as Blockchain. Many experts believe that Blockchain, a shared, digital record book (ledger) system would ensure that once a transaction of a sale or mortgage or like nature is recorded, it becomes immutable and cryptographically secured- Such reforms are essential to minimize the scourge of forgery and "clever drafting" that clogs our judicial system. Registered documents must inspire absolute confidence to ensure the ease of doing business and to uphold the sanctity of property titles in a modern economy. (Para 76-77)

Gloster Limited v. Gloster Cables Limited & Ors., 2026 INSC 81 - S.60 IBC - Trademark Title
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 - Section 60 - The interpretation of the phrase “arising out of or in relation to the insolvency resolution or liquidation proceedings of the corporate debtor or corporate person under this Code” will have to be contextualized with the facts arising in a given CIRP - The examination in each case will depend on the facts as they present themselves in a given CIRP - In this case, SC held that NCLT could not, under Section 60(5)(c) IBC, declare title to the trademark “Gloster” in favor of the Successful Resolution Applicant. (Para 25-37)
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 - Sections 43,55- To make out a case under Sections 43 and 45 of the IBC, rigorous scrutiny of documents and threadbare examination of the transactions needed to be undertaken and it could not have been carried out superficially- Section 47- If the Resolution Professional, in a given CIRP does not move an application, resort to Section 47 of the IBC could be had vis-à-vis undervalued transactions by a creditor, member or a partner of a corporate debtor as the case may be and they may move an application to the Adjudicating Authority to declare such transactions void and reverse their effect in accordance with the provisions of the IBC. (Para 43) -The parties mentioned therein while moving an application under Section 47, ought to set out sufficient materials and the party against whom the relief is sought ought to be put on notice of the averments and the relief prayed. (Para 49)

Naveen Kumar Sah v. State of Bihar - CrPC/BNSS - Quashing - Chargesheet Filed
Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 173, 482 : Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita - Section 528 - A petition to quash the FIR does not become infructuous on submission of a police report under Section 173(2) of the CrPC, but when a police report has been submitted, particularly when there is no stay on investigation, the Court must apply its mind to the materials submitted in support of the police report before taking a call whether the FIR and consequential proceedings should be quashed or not. [Context: The Supreme Court set aside a Patna High Court order that had quashed an FIR without considering a charge-sheet already filed by the Investigating Agency. ]

Asif Ali v. Rajesab - S.20 SRA -Discretion - Specific Performance


Specific Relief Act 1963 - Section 20 (prior to 2018 amendment)- The discretion to be exercised in a case for specific performance of a contract must be sound and reasonable and not arbitrary. Even if it is lawful to grant the relief, it may not be granted by the court of law in exercise of its discretion judiciously. [Context: The Trial Court, the First Appellate Court and the High Court had all decreed/affirmed specific performance, but the Supreme Court, applying the discretionary principles in Section 20, held that in the circumstances it was not appropriate to compel execution of the sale deed. Instead, the Court granted the alternative relief of refund.]


Rakesh Jain v. State - S.409 IPC - Company Director - Presumption On Culpability


Indian Penal Code 1860 - Section 409 - The allegations of diversion of funds by the Company - In an offence punishable under Section 409 IPC there is no presumption regarding culpability of a Director. The same would have to be established in a trial. (Para 13) [Context: The appeal arose from a Delhi High Court order refusing to extend interim bail to Rakesh Jain, a director of M/s Pragat Akshay Urja Limited, accused in an FIR alleging diversion of subsidy funds under sections 409/120B IPC - The Court found it improper that the High Court had repeatedly deferred deciding the regular bail application for want of further deposit. The Court directed the High Court to decide the regular bail application expeditiously.]


A. Shankar @ Savukku Shankar v. Secretary to Government -Writ Jurisdiction - Direction To File ChargeSheet


Constitution of India - Article 226 - High Court Direction for filing of charge-sheets by the investigating agency - If the High Court directs, at a stage prior to conclusion of investigation, that a charge-sheet has invariably to be filed upon closure of investigation in a particular case irrespective of what the materials are which have been collected during investigation and without allowing the investigating officer to form his own opinion as regards the next course of action, that would take away the discretion of such officer and he would be left with no other option but to proceed in the direction as required by the high court under pain of threat of contempt. Other than very extreme cases, the high courts ought to exercise restraint and not issue such directions which foreclose the discretion of the executive. [Context: The appellant had filed a writ petition before the Madras High Court seeking action on his complaints alleging abuse of power and false cases by the police, but the High Court, while dismissing the writ, went on to direct the police to file charge‑sheets in pending cases within four months and the trial courts to complete trials within six months - In Appeal, set aside this direction issued by the High Court.]


Constitution of India - Article 226 ; Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 482 ; Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 - Section 528- If any investigation is in progress, the accused generally cannot complain about its mode and manner before the writ court unless the First Information Report does not even prima facie disclose an offence or there are other vitiating factors and even then, only in rare cases can a writ court intervene to halt the investigation- It is the duty of the investigating officer to conduct free, fair and proper investigation and, thereafter, file an appropriate report in terms of Section 173, Cr. PC/Section 193, BNSS. If at all any procedure is given a go-bye in the process, the Cr. PC or the BNSS provides the remedy to the accused which, alone, ordinarily ought to be pursued.  (Para 19)


Quote - None can be put in a worse position for approaching the court of law and find himself in a position more disadvantageous than the position he was in, on the date he moved the court.  (Para 8)
