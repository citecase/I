The rule against bias would certainly be attracted where the person/authority intrinsically involved in the evaluation process has a personal connection with, personal interest in, or prior involvement in the matter under consideration, or has earlier taken a position which he may be interested in sustaining. The doctrine is applied not only to avoid the possibility of a partial decision but also to preserve public confidence in the impartiality of the decision-making process- where statutory or administrative power is exercised for purposes extraneous to those for which it is conferred, or is influenced by irrelevant considerations, or is actuated by malice in law, such exercise cannot be sustained. Judicial review in such circumstances is directed not merely at the decision but at the decision-making process itself. (Para 42-44)</span>

<span class="c3">Public Employment -</span><span class="c6"> State, being a model employer, is saddled with a heightened obligation in the discharge of its functions. A model employer is expected to act with high probity, fairness and candour, and bears a social responsibility to treat its employees in a manner that preserves their dignity. The State cannot be permitted to exploit its employees or to take advantage of their vulnerability, helplessness or unequal bargaining position. (Para 11) An employee who has satisfactorily discharged his duties over several years and has been granted repeated extensions cannot, overnight, be treated as surplus or undesirable. (Para 13) The State, as a model employer, cannot rely on contractual labels or mechanical application of Umadevi to justify prolonged ad-hocism or to discard long-serving employees in a manner inconsistent with fairness, dignity and constitutional governance. (Para 14)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Part III - Fundamental Rights -</span><span class="c6"> Contractual stipulations purporting to bar claims for regularization cannot override constitutional guarantees.

Very cogent and overwhelming circumstances are necessary for an order directing the cancellation of the bail, already granted. Generally speaking, the grounds for cancellation of bail, broadly (illustrative and not exhaustive) are: interference or attempt to interfere with the due course of administration of justice or evasion or attempt to evade the due course of justice or abuse of the concession granted to the accused in any manner. The satisfaction of the court, on the basis of material placed on the record of the possibility of the accused absconding is yet another reason justifying the cancellation of bail. However, bail once granted should not be cancelled in a mechanical manner without considering whether any supervening circumstances have rendered it no longer conducive to a fair trial to allow the accused to retain his freedom by enjoying the concession of bail during the trial.</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 21, 21A -</span><span class="c6"> The right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right to menstrual health. Access to safe, effective, and affordable menstrual hygiene management measures helps a girl child attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. The right to healthy reproductive life embraces the right to access education and information about sexual health- . Inaccessibility of menstrual hygiene management measures undermines the dignity of a girl child, as dignity finds expression in conditions that enable individuals to live without humiliation, exclusion, or avoidable suffering.

In case of a school not established, owned, or controlled by the appropriate Government or the local authority is found to be in contravention of the provisions of the RTE Act, it would be de-recognized and the consequences therefrom would follow. Insofar as a school established, owned, or controlled by the appropriate Government or the local authority is found to be in contravention of the provisions of the RTE Act, the State would be held accountable. (Para 172)</span>

<span class="c3">Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act)- Section 3 -</span><span class="c6">Section 3 of the RTE Act is not restricted to the formal entitlement of enrolment in a school. The right it guarantees is one of effective and continuous access to education. Section 3 incorporates the requirement that education shall be provided in conditions consistent with dignity and equality. The absence of sanitary napkins and safe disposal mechanisms compels menstruating girls to stay away from school for several days each month. When such circumstances continue to persist, it is an indication that the State has failed in ensuring regular attendance and continuity of education. This results in direct denial of the right guaranteed under Section 3. (Para 144)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 21 -</span><span class="c6"> The right to privacy entails a duty on the State to not only refrain from violating privacy but an accompanying ligation on the State to take necessary measures to protect the privacy of an individual.(Para 172)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 21A - </span><span class="c6">The fundamental right to education comprises free, compulsory, and quality education. Free education includes all kinds of charges or expenses that would prevent a child from pursuing and completing elementary education.  The right to education has been termed as a ‘multiplier right’ as it enables exercise of other human rights. The right to education forms part of the broader framework of the right to life and human dignity, which cannot be realized without access to education. (Para 172)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 14, 15,16 -</span><span class="c6">The substantive approach to equality under Article 14 demands that treatment be accorded with due regard to the individual, institutional, systemic, and contextual barriers that impede the translation of rights in reality. At the same time, the State, as a benefactor, is under an obligation to remedy such structural disadvantages. The right to equality is expressed through the right to participate on equal terms. At the same time, equality of opportunity necessitates that everyone has a fair chance to acquire the skills necessary to access benefits (Para 172) Article 15 and 16 constitute a substantive framework of equality that goes beyond formal non-discrimination. It seeks to ensure meaningful participation of disadvantaged and marginalized communities in social, educational, and public life. (Para 101)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 21,47 -</span><span class="c6"> To secure the right to health is not merely a right enshrined under Article 21 but also a duty on the State under Article 47 of the Constitution. Article 47 enjoins the State to improve public health as its primary duty. (Para 98)</span>

<span class="c3">Drugs Act, 1940 -</span><span class="c6"> Stem cell “therapy” for the treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) cannot continue as a commercial endeavour in the form of routine clinical treatment– Stem cell therapy is required to be undertaken in a clinical trial format. Although, the stem cells administered for therapeutic use in ASD are characterised as “drugs” under the Drugs Act, 1940, yet the same by itself is not determinative of the fact that it is permissible to be administered as a clinical service - Stem cell ‘therapies’ for ASD cannot be offered by medical practitioners as a clinical service, outside an approved and monitored clinical trial/research setting (Para 151,153)</span>

<span class="c3">Medical Profession -</span><span class="c6"> Every medical practitioner owes to his patient a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care, skill, and knowledge expected of a prudent practitioner in the same field. A medical practitioner cannot be said to meet the standard of reasonable care if he administers an intervention that lacks credible scientific evidence of safety and efficacy, or where authoritative medical bodies unequivocally state that such form of treatment is not recommended. if an intervention is characterised by the relevant scientific community or regulatory authorities, as unproven, experimental, obsolete, or lacking justification, such an intervention cannot be defended as exercise of due care and reasonable judgment by a medical practitioner. (Para 151)</span>

<span class="c3">Medical negligence -</span><span class="c6"> Experimental treatment - A medical practitioner who administers speculative, unproven, or experimental treatments even when credible professional bodies have expressly advised against the use of such an intervention, may be held liable on count of professional misconduct. The administration of such a treatment would fail to satisfy the standard of reasonable care necessitated under the established medical negligence jurisprudence in India. The only circumstance in which an experimental treatment may be provided is when it is administered within an approved research or clinical trial setting. (Para 151)</span>

<span class="c3">Medical Treatment</span><span class="c6">- Essentials of informed consent: (i) First, consent obtained by a medical practitioner must be real and valid. It is imperative that the following three conditions are met for a patient’s consent to be valid: • the patient should have the capacity and competence to consent; • consent should be voluntary; and • consent should be on the basis of adequate information, concerning the nature of the treatment procedure, so that the patient knows what the consent is for. (ii) Secondly, “adequate information” about a procedure or treatment must necessarily consist information about • the nature and procedure of the treatment; • its purpose and benefits; • its likely effects and complications; • any alternatives, if available; • an outline of the substantial risks; and • adverse consequences of refusing the treatment.</span>

<span class="c3">Legislation - Executive Instructions -</span><span class="c6"> instructions can only supplement a statute to address areas that are within the statute’s purview but have not been covered thereby.

Holding that the mandatory safeguards for search and seizure were not complied with and that reasonable doubt existed, the Court set aside the conviction and sentence, acquitted the accused, and ordered his immediate release and return of his original passport.</span>

Courts exercising writ jurisdiction must remain circumspect while entertaining petitions that hinge upon disputed questions of fact, particularly where such disputes require detailed examination of evidence or adjudication of rival factual claims. Public interest litigation cannot be permitted to become a vehicle for selective or targeted challenges, nor can it be invoked to resolve contested factual issues which are not capable of determination on affidavits alone.

(Para 47) \[Context: In this case, the property was neither specified in the ‘list of auqaf’ as published in Chapter II nor registered under Chapter V. SC held: hence the decision as to whether the property is a waqf property or not cannot be decided by the Tribunal since the property is not one specified in the ‘list of auqaf’, which is the mandatory requirement under Section 6(1) and Section 7(1) of the Waqf Act of 1995 to approach the Tribunal - The injunction simpliciter sought for before the Tribunal does not fall within its jurisdiction and the plaint has to be rejected\]</span>

<span class="c3">Legislation</span><span class="c6"> - An Amendment will be retrospective only if expressly provided for and at times, when it follows by necessary implication - a vested right can be taken away by a subsequent enactment which by express words or necessary intendment makes it retrospective. (Para 31) An amendment by way of substitution does not invariably result in a retrospective application. Retrospectivity is not to be presumed and the presumption is to the contrary, held it was open for the legislature to enact laws having retrospective operation, by express enactment or by necessary implication from the language employed(Para 33)</span>

<span class="c3">Precedent</span><span class="c6"> - If divergent view has to be taken, necessarily the Coordinate Bench, should referred the matter to a Larger Bench.( Para 28)</span>

<span class="c3">Code of Civil Procedure 1908 - Section 9- </span><span class="c6">Even if the statute accords finality to the orders of the Tribunal, a Court will have to see whether the Tribunal has the power to grant the reliefs, which the Civil Courts would normally grant and if the answer is in the negative, ordinarily there can be no inference of exclusion of the Civil Courts’ jurisdiction.

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226 -</span><span class="c6"> The remedy of a writ is discretionary in nature. Even where a writ petition raises a substantial point of law, the High Court may decline to entertain it for a variety of reasons. Inter alia, relief may be denied to the suitor notwithstanding the existence of a strong legal case should grant of such relief not serve or advance public interest. If interfering with an impugned order/decision etc. would result in more harm to society, the writ courts may decline to exercise its jurisdiction. The high courts, being the custodian of the Constitution, carry the responsibility to maintain social balance by its interference when justice of the case so demands and in not interfering when such an interference would affect public interest.

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226 - Writ Appeal - Intra Court Appeal -</span><span class="c6"> The exercise of intra-court appellate jurisdiction is warranted only where the judgment or order under challenge is demonstrably erroneous or suffers from perversity. Such jurisdiction ought not to be invoked merely because another view is possible on the same set of facts, particularly where the view adopted by the Single Judge is a plausible and reasonable one- An intra-court appellate Bench ought not to substitute its own view, merely because such Bench considers its view to be better than the one taken by the Single Bench; so long as the view taken by the Single Bench is a plausible one, interference should stay at a distance.

<span class="c3">Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 (BNSS) - Section 175(4)-</span><span class="c6"> The opening words in sub-section (4) which reads “Any Magistrate empowered under Section 210, may, upon receiving a complaint against a public servant ……” have to be purposively read as ‘Any Magistrate empowered under Section 210, may, upon receiving a complaint in writing against a public servant of commission of offence arising in course of the discharge of his official duties, supported by an affidavit, order investigation, subject to ... ’ (Para 39)– Upon receiving a complaint under sub-section (4) of Section 175, BNSS alleging commission of an offence by a public servant arising in course of the discharge of his official duties, the magistrate may do either of the following- (1) Reading the complaint, if the judicial magistrate is prima facie satisfied that commission of the alleged act giving rise to an offence arose in course of discharge of official duties by the public servant, such magistrate may not have any option other than following the procedure prescribed under sub-section (4) of Section 175 of calling for reports from the superior officer and the accused public servant. Or (2) on a consideration of the complaint, where the judicial magistrate entertains a prima facie doubt depending upon the circumstances as to whether the offence alleged to have been committed by the public servant arose in course of discharge of his official duties, such magistrate might err on the side of caution and proceed to follow the procedure prescribed in sub-section (4) of Section 175 Or (3) where the judicial magistrate is satisfied that the alleged act of offence was not committed in the discharge of official duties and/or it bears no reasonable nexus thereto, and also that the rigours of sub-section (4) of Section 175 are not attracted, the complaint may be dealt with in accordance with the general procedure prescribed under sub-section (3) of Section 175. The judicial magistrate would continue to retain the authority to reject an application under sub-section (3) of Section 175, lodged against a public servant, where such magistrate finds that the allegations made therein are wholly untenable, manifestly absurd, or so inherently improbable that no reasonable person could conclude that any offence is disclosed. However, it is needless to observe, such an order of rejection ought not to be based on whims and fancy but must have the support of valid reasons- in an appropriate case, the judicial magistrate has called for a report from the concerned superior officer under clause (a) of sub-section (4) of Section 175, but such officer fails to comply with the direction or does not submit the report within a reasonable period of time- the judicial magistrate is not obliged to wait indefinitely for compliance and 43 may proceed further in accordance with sub-section (3) of Section 175 after considering the version of the accused public servant under clause (b) of sub-section (4) of Section 175, if on record. What would constitute ‘reasonable time’ cannot be determined in rigid or inflexible terms and must necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case before the judicial magistrate who has to take the call. (Para 42-48)</span>

<span class="c3">Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 (BNSS) - Section 175 (3) , 333 -</span><span class="c6"> An affidavit, such as the one referred to in subsection (3) of Section 175, must fulfil the conditions provided in Section 333, BNSS. (Para 41)</span>

<span class="c3">Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 (BNSS) -</span><span class="c6"> Section Section 218 - Section 218 operates at the stage of taking cognizance when the “previous sanction” of the concerned Government is required. (Para 40)</span>

<span class="c3">Interpretation of Statutes - Proviso -</span><span class="c19"> A proviso is an internal aid to construction. It is appended to a section of an enactment or any sub-section of a section. A proviso to a particular provision of a statute only embraces the field which is covered by the main provision. It carves out an exception to the main provision to which it has been enacted as a proviso and to no other. A test one may apply to determine whether a provision is a proviso rather than a separate provision is to ask whether if the “main” provision is removed, would the concerned provision still be capable of being applied. If yes, then the provision cannot normally be considered a proviso. (Para 32-36) </span><span class="c3">Sub-Section</span><span class="c6"> - Ordinarily, sub-sections of a section of an Act usually deal with related, parallel aspects with one sub-section dealing with a general principle and the other providing for a specific aspect, on its own terms. (Para 37.2)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226 -</span><span class="c6"> The writ court will, normally, grant relief that is prayed; and, though discretion to grant relief under Article 226 is wide, the writ court cannot, ignoring and keeping aside the norms and principles governing grant of relief, proceed to grant a relief not even prayed by the petitioner. (Para 51)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226 -</span><span class="c6"> Seeking a declaratory relief that the acts of offence committed by the accused public servants did not arise in the discharge of official duties by them without the order of the JMFC (calling for a report) being challenged would have necessarily required the writ court to embark on a fact-finding exercise in that behalf, as if it were a court of a magistrate. A writ court is a court exercising high prerogative writ jurisdiction; such court could not have been urged by the appellant to convert itself into a court for conducting sort of a magisterial inquiry. (Para 56)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226 -</span><span class="c6"> A judicial order in a civil matter cannot be challenged in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution- the principle has been extended to judicial orders passed in criminal matters. (Para 52)</span>

<span class="c3">Summary</span><span class="c6">: Supreme Court upheld the Kerala High Court Division Bench’s reversal of the Single Judge, holds that the Single Judge exceeded writ jurisdiction by effectively directing recall of a judicial order of the Magistrate.</span>

Registry cannot make inroads into areas within the exclusive domain of the judiciary and seek clarification as to why a particular party has been joined as a respondent.

<span class="c3">Delegated Legislation - </span><span class="c6">Publication of promulgation is indispensable to enforceability of subordinate legislation- When the parent statute prescribes a particular mode of publication, that mode must be strictly followed (Para 18)- The true test of the effective commencement of a statutory order or subordinate legislation is whether it has been published in a manner reasonably calculated to bring it to the notice of all persons who may be affected by it, namely, through a mode which is ordinarily and generally accepted for that purpose. (Para 17) Once the legislature has prescribed the specified mode of promulgation, the executive cannot introduce an alternative mode and attribute legal consequences to it. (Para 19)</span>

Notwithstanding the dates from which these two enactments were brought into force, the BOCW Act and the Cess Act remained dormant, in fact, owing to the failure of the appropriate Governments in taking necessary measures to bring the provisions thereof into actual effect -The Cess Act is complementary to the BOCW Act and was enacted for augmenting the resources of the Welfare Boards, constituted under Section 18 of the BOCW Act. Therefore, in the absence of such Welfare Boards, levy and collection of cess under the Cess Act did not arise, given the scheme and structure of the two Acts and the Rules - constitution of Welfare Boards was essential and was a condition precedent for levy and collection of the cess in relation to the BOCW Act and the Cess Act.

If there is no compatibility, there are modes available for early resolution of disputes. Process of mediation is the mode which can be explored at the stage of pre-litigation and even after litigation starts. When the parties start litigating against each other, especially on criminal side, the chances of reunion are remote but should not be ruled out. (Para 21) First and the foremost, earnest effort should be made by the parties and to be guided by the advocates, whensoever consulted in the process, is to convince them for a pre-litigation mediation. Rather in some cases, their counselling may be required - Even if a case is filed in a Court on a trivial issue such as maintenance under Section 144 of BNSS, 2023 (earlier Section 125 of CrPC, 1973) or Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the first effort required to be made by the Court is to explore mediation instead of calling upon the parties for filing replies as allegations and counter allegations sometimes aggravate the dispute. Even when a complaint is sought to be registered with the police of simple matrimonial dispute, first and the foremost effort has to be for re-conciliation, that too, if possible, through the mediation centers in the Courts, instead of calling the parties to the police stations. This sometimes becomes a point of no return specially when any of the parties is arrested, may it be even for a day. (Para 24) It is the duty of all concerned including the family members of the parties to make their earnest effort to resolve the disputes before any civil or criminal proceedings are launched.(Para 25)</span>

Yati Jain ; 2026 INSC 64 - Waiting List - Writ Appeal -LPA</a></span>

<span class="c3">Service Law - Waiting List -</span><span class="c6"> The key aspects of a waiting list, in relation to service law disputes: (i) a waiting list is normally prepared after the select/merit list is drawn; (ii) it would include candidates who have qualified the recruitment examination but are not so meritorious such that they can be immediately appointed on the number of vacancies advertised; (iii) such list would operate like a merit-based queue for vacancies that remain unfilled after offers of appointment given to the candidates in the select/merit list are not accepted; (iv) a waiting list has a limited validity period; (v) validity period of a waiting list depends on the recruitment rules and should no such period be mentioned, it can bona fide be operated till the next advertisement is issued without, however, violating provisions in such rules, if any, requiring recruitment process to be initiated either semi-annually or annually; and (vi) an opportunity to a candidate in the waiting list for securing appointment arises only when vacancies remain unfilled after the process of appointing candidates from the select/merit list is over and hence, it is regarded as a procedural outcome which is part of a structured process rather than a fortuitous circumstance- A wait-listed candidate has no right of appointment, much less an indefeasible right, except when the governing recruitment rules permit a small window authorizing appointments therefrom in the specified exceptional circumstances and the appointing authority, for no good reason, denies or refuses an appointment or the reason assigned therefor is found to be arbitrary and/or discriminatory and that too, when the waiting list has not expired.  (Para 86-90)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226 -Intra Court Jurisdiction - Letters patent appeal - </span><span class="c19">A letters patent appeal, as permitted under the Letters Patent, is normally an intra-court appeal whereunder the Letters Patent Bench, sitting as a “Court of Correction”, corrects its own orders in exercise of the same jurisdiction as was vested in the Single Bench: Exercise of intra-court appellate jurisdiction could be called for if the judgment/order under challenge is palpably erroneous or suffers from perversity; but, it may not be exercised when two views are possible on a given set of facts and one of two views has been taken which is a plausible view.  (Para 50-51) “</span><span class="c3">Person aggrieved”:</span><span class="c6"> A writ appeal is a continuation of the original writ petition - anyone who may file a writ petition would have the locus standi to file a writ appeal albeit with some caveats: A person aggrieved having locus standi to prefer an appeal would be one who is directly affected or impacted by a judgment, order or decision even though the same does not directly require him to do something, or, one, who being a party to a suit, is adversely affected by the decree. To file an appeal, such a person typically needs to show affectation of a legal right or interest, or that he is likely to suffer a legal wrong as a result of its impact. A mere interest or concern in the subject matter decided by the original court would not be enough - the conditions that need to be satisfied before a person is entitled to maintain an appeal. These are: 1) that the appealing party has been a party in the proceedings from which the appeal has arisen; 2) that the definitive and conclusive ruling of the High Court on the rights of the parties in dispute is the subject of the appeal; and 3) that he is a ‘person aggrieved’, that is, a party who has been adversely affected by the determination.  Condition (1) supra may, however, stand relaxed in given cases (Para 50- 67)</span>

<span class="c3">Appeal</span><span class="c6"> -An appeal is always a creature of statute - The right of appeal is the right of reaching out to a superior court, invoking its authority to have a relook at the facts vis-àvis the law applicable and to rectify the errors committed by a court inferior in the hierarchy. It is a very valuable right. Therefore, when the statute confers such a right of appeal, it is open to the person aggrieved to seek correction of the errors committed by the inferior court. (Para 45-46)</span>

<span class="c3">Public Service Commission</span><span class="c6"> - Although the recommendations made by a Public Service Commission are not binding and hence, may or may not be accepted by the Government of the State, one thing is clear: the latter has no authority to appoint anyone not recommended by the former. (Para 73)</span>

<span class="c3">Executive instructions</span><span class="c6">  - executive instructions may supplement, but not supplant, statutory rules and should be subservient to statutory provisions.</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 14,226 </span><span class="c6">- Perpetuation of illegality ought to be shunned by any Court of law. This forms the basis for denying the plea of negative equality -The illegality in recommending some of the candidates figuring in the reserve list could not have been made the basis for issuance of a writ of mandamus citing Article 14 of the Constitution.  (Para 101-102)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226 - Service Disputes </span><span class="c6">- A substantial number of service-related disputes pending across the country are aggravated by protracted and recurring litigation, resulting in a state of perpetual flux for many candidates across the country. The judiciary would do well to remain circumspect of these practical realities, and interpret service rules in a manner that furthers the very object of a selection process, that is, the selection of the most suitable candidates from suitable candidates for appointment in a timely manner. (Para 123)</span>

<span class="c3">Summary</span><span class="c6">: Appeal by the Rajasthan Public Service Commission against High Court orders that had directed the appointment of candidates from a reserve list after several originally selected individuals failed to join their posts - Allowing appeal, SC held  that the Commission had the locus standi to appeal as a constitutional body ; wait-listed candidates possess no indefeasible right to appointment, particularly once the statutory validity period of the list has lapsed; the six-month validity of a reserve list under the relevant rules must be strictly calculated from the date the original list was forwarded rather than from the date a vacancy later arose due to non-joining.</span>

Exercising Article 142, the Court issued directions including mandatory police reporting of any student suicide or unnatural death, annual reporting to regulators, filling faculty and leadership vacancies within four months, clearing scholarship backlogs promptly, ensuring round-the-clock medical access, and strict compliance with UGC regulations on equity, anti‑ragging, sexual harassment, and grievance redressal.

Thus, an agreement to sell or a contract for sale with or without possession is not a conveyance deed. Therefore, a sale of immovable property can only be made by a registered instrument and that an agreement of sale does not create any interest or charge on its subject matter. (Para 5.10)</span>

<span class="c3">Transfer of Property Act 1882- Section 53A- </span><span class="c6">Section 53A applies to a person who contracts to transfer immovable property in writing.

The gravity is significantly compounded when the non-disclosure is repeated, as it ceases to be accidental or inadvertent and instead reflects deliberate concealment. Such strikes at the core of trust reposed in candidates for public service, where honesty and transparency are indispensable attributes, and justify a far stricter view by the authorities.

If the interest of the deceased party is sufficiently represented by other parties already on record, and the decree/order eventually passed in the suit or proceeding would not be rendered non-executable for absence of that party, the suit or proceeding would not abate.

Reason being that the transferee/ third party cannot be subjected to special covenants, if any, between the vendor and the plaintiff-purchaser. Besides that, the object of the decree of specific performance is to put the person who has agreed to purchase the property in the same position which he would have obtained in case the contracting parties i.e., vendor and the purchaser had, pursuant to the agreement, executed a deed of sale and completed it in every way. </span>

If the age is under question, the bail Court may examine the documents produced to establish age, but it will not enter into the question of those documents being correct or not so - A medical determination of age of a victim cannot be resorted to as a matter of course, much less mandated. It can only be employed in a given circumstance when the other stipulations of Section 94 JJ Act are not/cannot be met. (Para 16-17) If the question of age is raised at the stage of bail, it is only open for the Court to, from the perusal of the documents, take a prima facie view as to the age of the victim, not one on the correctness of the documents since that would amount to a mini trial. (Para 18)</span>

<span class="c3">Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 439</span><span class="c6">- Court’s jurisdiction, i.e., either the Court of Sessions or the High Court under Section 439 CrPC is limited to adjudicating the question of the person concerned being released into society pending trial or whether they should continue to be incarcerated. (Para 11.2) Section 439 is limited to granting bail or anticipatory bail and requires the Court to consider only prima facie evidence, the risk of the accused absconding, tampering with evidence, or other relevant factors- The Court cannot undertake a mini trial at the bail stage.

<span class="c3">POCSO Act - JJ Act -</span><span class="c6"> Unlike an offender who can claim benefit of juvenility at any point in time, even after completion of proceedings given the beneficial nature of the JJ Act, a victim of a crime cannot claim to be a juvenile at any point in time, for the charges against which an offender is tried, are intrinsically tied to the age of the victim.(Para 14.9)</span>

<span class="c3">JJ Act- </span><span class="c6">The object of Section 9 is to ensure that no juvenile offender is tried as an adult merely due to an initial misclassification and to safeguard the rehabilitative and welfare-oriented spirit of the juvenile justice system by ensuring that every child in conflict with law is tried by the appropriate forum, i.e., the JJB. (Para 14.6)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitutional powers and Statutory Powers -</span><span class="c6">Constitutional powers are sovereign, foundational, and insulated from the vicissitudes of ordinary legislation; they can neither be curtailed nor expanded by parliamentary enactment. Statutory powers, by contrast, are subordinate and mutable, existing at the pleasure of the Legislature, which may at any time amend, restrict, or repeal them through the ordinary legislative process. The constitutional power cannot overshadow the statutory power, enlarging its scope beyond what has been envisaged by the statute -while both powers rest with the High Court, one power cannot usurp the ambit of another, unless otherwise permitted by law. (Para 11.3)</span>

<span class="c3">Summary</span><span class="c6">: The Supreme Court set aside an Allahabad High Court judgment that, while granting bail in a POCSO case, mandated medical age determination at the investigation’s outset and allowed bail courts to weigh age-document credibility. It held that bail jurisdiction under Section 439 CrPC is limited, age determination of the victim must follow Section 94 JJ Act during trial (medical tests only if documents are unavailable), and bail courts cannot conduct a mini-trial or fuse constitutional powers into statutory proceedings. The Court preserved existing bail orders, prospectively nullified the High Court’s directions (including in Monish and Aman), and urged consideration of reforms like a Romeo–Juliet clause to prevent misuse of POCSO in consensual adolescent relationships.</span>

This assessment may turn on whether: (A) The old stock-in-trade has ceased to exist in the assessee’s books; (B) The shares received in the amalgamated company possess a definite and ascertainable value; and (C) The assessee, immediately upon allotment, is in a position to dispose of such shares and realise money- If these conditions are satisfied, the substitution bears the character of a commercial realisation and the profit may be taxed under Section 28. Where, however, the allotment of shares is merely a statutory substitution mandated by the scheme of amalgamation, without yielding an immediately realisable benefit, no income can be said to accrue or be received at that stage, and taxability arises only upon the eventual sale of the shares (Para 18)</span>

<span class="c3">Income Tax Act, 1961 - Section 260-A -Scope -</span><span class="c6"> Limits higher appellate interference to questions of law, while at the same time, permitting the Court to deal with necessary or incidental questions that arise, provided reasons are recorded and parties are heard -Merely because a specific substantial question of law was not framed, it cannot be concluded that prejudice was caused to the parties, if both parties had the opportunity to address the issues in dispute. (Para 9)</span>

<span class="c3">Income Tax Act, 1961 -Difference between a charging provision and an exemption provision:</span><span class="c6"> A provision that enables the levy of tax on a particular transaction is a charging provision. Only a transaction that is covered by a charging provision is taxable. Only if the transaction is taxable can there be an exemption. (Para 12.1)</span>

<span class="c3">Amalgamation</span><span class="c6"> - Amalgamation, in corporate law, signifies the statutory blending of two or more undertakings into one. It is distinct from winding up: while the transferor company ceases to exist as a separate corporate entity, its business, assets, and liabilities are absorbed into and continue within the transferee -The transferor company ceases to exist, and the transferee emerges with a blended corporate personality, inheriting all rights and liabilities. (Para 16) Companies Act, 2013 contains no express definition of amalgamation. Amalgamation – ordinarily effected through a scheme of compromise or arrangement sanctioned by the Court or Tribunal – is founded on agreement between shareholders and creditors, but its legal effect is statutory: upon sanction, all assets, rights, and liabilities of the transferor vest in the transferee by operation of law. In other words, amalgamation is more than a mere contractual transfer; it is a statutory process of substitution. (Para 16.1)</span>

<span class="c3">Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of BootLeggers, Dacoits, Drug-Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders \[Land-Grabbers, Spurious Seed Offenders, Insecticide Offenders, Fertiliser Offenders, Food Adulteration Offenders, Fake Document Offenders, Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, Gaming Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Explosive Substances Offenders, Arms Offenders, Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders\] Act, 1986 -</span><span class="c6"> Mere apprehension on the part of the detaining authority that in the event of the detenu being released on bail, she was likely to indulge in similar crimes that would be prejudicial to maintenance of public order would not be a sufficient ground to order her preventive detention - Mere reproduction of the expressions mentioned in Section 2(a) of the Act of 1986 in the order of detention would not be sufficient. The detention order ought to indicate the recording of subjective satisfaction by the detaining authority in that regard.- There is a fine distinction between “law and order” and “public order”. Mere registration of three offences by itself would not have any bearing on the maintenance of public order unless there is material to show that the narcotic drug dealt with by the detenu was in fact dangerous to public health under the Act of 1986.  (Para 9-10)</span>

<span class="c3">Summary</span><span class="c6">: The Supreme Court allowed the appeal of Roshini Devi, quashing her mother’s preventive detention under the Telangana Act of 1986 because the detaining authority failed to show how her alleged drug-related activities affected public order rather than merely law and order. The Court criticized reliance on bail apprehensions and past history without taking ordinary-law measures like bail cancellation, citing precedents that preventive detention is an extraordinary remedy requiring specific, relevant material and genuine subjective satisfaction. It set aside the High Court’s dismissal, ordered the detenu’s release if not wanted elsewhere, and emphasized the distinction between public order and law and order.</span>

<span class="c3">Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 482 ; Negotiable Instruments Act 1881- Section 139 - </span><span class="c6">The statutory presumption attached to the issuance of a cheque, being one made in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability, is required to be accorded due weight. Therefore, in circumstances where the accused approaches the Court seeking quashing of proceedings even before the commencement of trial, the Court must exercise circumspection and refrain from prematurely stifling the prosecution at the threshold, particularly by overlooking the legal presumption that operates in favour of the complainant. (Para 43) Whether those cheques were issued as alternative or supplementary instruments, or represented fresh undertakings, is a disputed question of fact requiring evidence at the time of trial and cannot be resolved at the threshold. Questions such as whether the firm’s cheques were issued in substitution of the personal cheques, whether the parties treated them as alternative securities, and whether both were intended to be simultaneously enforceable, are all mixed questions of fact. The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.PC cannot be used to decide such disputed issues. (Para 34)</span>

<span class="c3">Negotiable Instruments Act 1881- Section 139</span><span class="c6">- The burden of proving whether there exists any debt or liability is something which must be discharged in trial. A bare perusal of Section 139 of the NI Act would indicate that once a cheque is issued in discharge of liability and dishonoured, a presumption of liability in favour of the complainant arises. The accused person is then required to rebut the presumption by raising facts that either there was no debt or liability when the cheque was drawn, or the cheque was not drawn in discharge of liability, or notice was not served in time. (Para 42)</span>

<span class="c3">Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 482 -</span><span class="c6"> Even though the powers under Section 482 of the Cr.PC are very wide, its conferment requires the High Court to be more cautious and diligent.

The Court must only consider whether there exists any sufficient material to proceed against the accused or not. (Para 28)</span>

<span class="c3">Summary</span><span class="c6">: The Supreme Court addressed multiple Section 138 NI Act complaints arising from dishonoured cheques linked to a 2016 Agreement to Sell, where MGI Developers failed to execute sale deeds and issued both firm and personal cheques that were later returned unpaid. It held that each dishonour created a distinct cause of action, set aside the High Court’s quashing of Complaint Case No. 3298/2019, and allowed that case to proceed, while upholding the refusal to quash Complaint Case Nos. 2823/2019, 13508/2019, and 743/2020. The Court emphasized that disputed factual issues and the statutory presumption under Section 139 must be tested at trial, leaving all contentions open.</span>

Whether these allegations can ultimately be proved is a matter strictly within the province of the Trial Court (Para 25)-when a factual foundation for prosecution exists, criminal law cannot be short-circuited by invoking inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.PC.

<span class="c6"></span>

<span class="c3">Arbitration and Conciliation Act - Section 34,37</span><span class="c6">- The scope of interference of the court with the arbitral matters is virtually prohibited, if not absolutely barred. The powers of the Appellate Court are even more restricted than the powers conferred by Section 34 of the Act. The appellate power under Section 37 of the Act is exercisable only to find out if the court exercising power under Section 34 of the Act, has acted within its limits as prescribed thereunder or has exceeded or failed to exercise the power so conferred. The Appellate Court exercising powers under Section 37 of the Act has no authority of law to consider the matter in dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal on merits so as to hold as to whether the award of the Arbitral Tribunal is right or wrong. The Appellate Court in exercise of such power cannot sit as an ordinary court of appeal and reappraise the evidence to record a contrary finding. The award of the Arbitral Tribunal cannot be touched by the court unless it is contrary to the substantive provision of law or any provision of the Act or the terms of the agreement. (Para 37) </span>

<span class="c3">Arbitration</span><span class="c6"> - The Act is a special enactment which aims to resolve contractual/commercial disputes through arbitration with the minimum intervention of the court, if not without the intervention of the court. In the event, the courts are allowed to step in at every stage and the arbitral awards are subjected to challenge before the courts in hierarchy before court of first instance, through regular appeals and finally by means of SLP/Civil Appeal before the Supreme Court, it would obviate/frustrate and defeat the very purpose of the Act. It is therefore, necessary to accept the arbitral award if it is not patently illegal or does not fall within the scope of intervention under Section 34 of the Act. The appeal thereof has a much narrower scope of intervention particularly when the arbitral award has been upheld under Section 34 of the Act. The appellate jurisdiction acquires little significance only when the arbitral award has been erroneously upheld or set aside by the court in exercise of its power under Section 34 of the Act.

The presence of any additional pre-emptory language in the form of “but not thereafter” or “shall” would not always be necessary to convey that the prescribed period is mandatory.Section 433 of the Act, 2013 which empowers the NCLT and the NCLAT respectively to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963, as far as may be, to the proceedings and appeals before itself, cannot be borrowed to signify the existence of a similar power with respect to the CLB. Regulation 44 of the CLB Regulations which saves the inherent power of the CLB would not enable the CLB to extend time for the filing of the appeal or the application itself, as the case may be.(Para 100)</span>

<span class="c3">Limitation Act 1963 - Section 5 -</span><span class="c19">The provisions of the Act, 1963 (provisions that lay down a prescribed period of limitation as well as Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 respectively) would only apply to suits, applications or appeals, as the case may be, which are made under any law to ‘courts’ and not to those made before quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, unless such quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals are specifically empowered in that regard.</span><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c6">(Para 160)The principles underlying Section 5 cannot be applied to quasi-judicial bodies (Para 65).  The discretionary power to adjust the period of limitation itself, must be specifically granted to the concerned quasi-judicial body or tribunal and there must be a reasonable indication from the language of the statute that such a discretion which is otherwise vested in civil courts, is also vested in the concerned quasi-judicial body. (Para 90)The argument that the principles underlying Sections 6 or 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively, could be applied to quasi-judicial bodies is not sufficient reason to hold the same insofar as Section 5 of the Act, 1963 is concerned. (Para 93)</span>

<span class="c3">Inherent Powers</span><span class="c6">- Although the exercise of inherent powers are in addition to the powers specifically conferred on the concerned body or institution, yet such an exercise of power must be complementary to and not be in conflict with any express provision or be contrary to the intention of the legislature.

As a natural corollary, if Section 29(2) is, by itself, inapplicable to a particular case then there would be no need to look into or analyse whether there is any express exclusion.

<span class="c3">Words and Phrases -</span><span class="c6"> The term “initiation” connotes the act of causing something to begin or taking the first step towards beginning a process, whereas “commencement” denotes the actual beginning of the process itself, which is a step further than mere initiation.

<span class="c3">Disciplinary Proceedings -</span><span class="c6"> The enquiry report in disciplinary proceedings is not conclusive of the guilt or otherwise of the delinquent employee, which finding is in the exclusive domain of the disciplinary authority. The enquiry officer is appointed only as a convenient measure to bring on record the allegations against the delinquent employee and the proof thereof and to ensure an opportunity to the delinquent employee to contest and defend the same by cross-examination of the witnesses proffered by the department and even production of further evidence, in defense. The enquiry officer, strictly speaking, merely records the evidence and the finding entered on the basis of the evidence led at the enquiry does not have any bearing on the final decision of the disciplinary authority. The disciplinary authority takes the ultimate call as to whether to concur with the findings of the enquiry authority or to differ therefrom. On a decision being taken to differ from the findings in the enquiry report as to the guilt of the delinquent employee, if it is in favour of the delinquent employee nothing more needs to be done since the enquiry stands closed exonerating the employee of the charges levelled. If the decision is to concur with the finding of guilt by the Enquiry Officer, then a show-cause is issued with the copy of the Enquiry Report. However, while differing from the finding of exoneration in the enquiry report, necessarily the disciplinary authority will not only have to issue a show-cause against the delinquent employee, with a copy of the Enquiry Report, but the show-cause notice also has to specifically bring to attention of the delinquent, the aspects on which the disciplinary authority proposes to differ, based on the facts discovered in the enquiry so as to afford the delinquent employee an opportunity to proffer his defense to the same.

Just as modification of recruitment norms is forbidden in law after the recruitment process has begun, it is equally illegal for an admission process to not be fully defined in all its contours before its commencement, so as to leave room for the authorities concerned to stipulate norms later on to suit their own interests or to permit nepotism. The transparency of such a process is paramount to ensure fairness and prevent arbitrariness. (Para 18) When a thing is done in a post-haste manner, malafides would be presumed as anything done with undue haste can be termed arbitrary and would not be condonable in law.

Sections 219 to 223 CrPC constitute exceptions to this general rule and stipulate the circumstances in which deviation therefrom can be made. Under Section 219 CrPC, three such offences committed during a year can be the subject matter of a single trial \[now, five such offences, under Section 242 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)\]. Under Sections 220(1) CrPC and 223(a) and (d) CrPC, consolidated charges can be framed against several accused persons in relation to several offences, if such offences are committed during the course of the same transaction. It would, therefore, turn upon the offences forming part of the ‘same transaction’ - Triple tests, though not to be applied cumulatively, to decide when separate actions can be treated as part of the ‘same transaction’ – 1) unity of purpose and design; 2) proximity of time and place; and 3) continuity of action. These tests may be applied to ascertain whether a series of acts form part of the same transaction or not - If it is opined that all the incidents partake of the same transaction, there can be one trial under Section 220(1) CrPC and Section 223(a) and (d) CrPC. If, however, it is concluded that there are several transactions and distinct offences in relation to different victims, there have to be separate trials for each offence, subject to Section 219 CrPC/ Section 242 BNSS, which allows the Trial Court to try three/five offences of the same kind committed within a year. Once all the incidents are taken to be part of the same transaction and amalgamated into one FIR, the punishment would follow accordingly as per law. (Para 19-20)</span>

The power of retrospective legislation cannot be exercised to take away vested rights or to arbitrarily disrupt a selection process that has already resulted in the identification of successful candidates by publication of a provisional merit list -Once a candidate has cleared the written examination and found a place in the merit list based on the announced criteria in line with the extant Rules and the advertisement, a legitimate expectation arises that the selection will be finalized based on the criteria which was advertised at the time of initiation of the recruitment process- The State cannot rely on executive instructions to override statutory rules that were in force during the initiation of the recruitment process, especially to the detriment of candidates who had no notice of such weightage or age relaxation. (Para 39) Even assuming that the 2022 Amendment Rules are policy decisions of the State, they cannot be implemented in a manner that violates the fundamental right to equality under Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India by changing the selection criteria after the selection process has already begun.

<span class="c6"></span>

<span class="c3">Taxation Laws -The application of the common or trade parlance test while dealing with classification disputes </span><span class="c6">a. The common or trade parlance test must be applied restrictively. Its function is limited to ascertaining the common or commercial meaning of a term found within a tariff heading or its defining criterion. b. The trade or common parlance test can be invoked when dealing with a classification dispute only when the following conditions are satisfied. i. The governing statute, including the relevant tariff heading, Section Notes, Chapter Notes, or HSN Explanatory Notes, does not provide any explicit definition or clear criteria for determining the meaning and scope of the tariff item in question. ii. The tariff heading does not include scientific or technical terms, or the words used in the heading are not employed in a specialised, technical context. iii. The application of the common parlance test must not contradict or run counter to the overall statutory framework and the contextual manner in which the term was used by the legislature. Thus, broadly speaking, the common or trade parlance test cannot be invoked where the statute, either explicitly or implicitly, provides definitive guidance. Explicit statutory guidance exists where the legislature provides a specific definition or a clear criterion for a term within the Act itself. Conversely, implicit guidance is found where the terms employed are scientific or technical in nature, or where the statutory context indicates that the words must be construed in a technical sense. It is only in a state of statutory silence, where the legislative intent remains unexpressed, that the tribunals or courts may resort to the common or trade parlance test. c. In the contemporary HSN-based classification regime, the common or trade parlance test cannot serve as a measure of first resort. It should only be employed after a thorough review of all relevant material confirms the absence of statutory guidance. d. When interpreting terms in a tariff item by relying on the basis of common or trade parlance, an overly simplified approach should be avoided, and the words should be understood within their legal context. Further, when a party asserts a meaning of a term based on common or trade parlance, it must present satisfactory evidence to support that claim. e. When a tariff item is general in nature and does not indicate a particular industry or trade circle, the common parlance understanding of that term is appropriate. However, when a tariff item is specific to a particular industry, the term must be understood as it is used within that specific trade circle. f. The common or trade parlance test cannot be used to override the clear mandate of the statute. Specifically: i. The test cannot be applied in a way that results in the reclassification of a good that is clearly identifiable under a particular heading according to the statute, simply because that good is marketed or called by a different name in trade or common parlance. ii. Conversely, the test cannot be used to challenge the classification of goods under a statutory heading if those goods retain the essential characteristics defined by that heading, even if they have a unique or specialised trade name. In other words, the character and nature of the product cannot be veiled behind a charade of terminology which is used to market the product or refer to it in common or commercial circles. g. To establish a separate commercial identity, it is essential to demonstrate that the good has undergone such a substantial transformation that it can no longer be characterised as a mere sub-type or category of a broader class and thus falls outside the ambit of the common or commercial understanding associated with such a class of goods.(Para 66) \[SC held that the ‘mushroom growing apparatus’ is not classified as ‘machinery’ and further, that the subject goods are ‘structures’ rather than ‘parts’ of machinery.\]</span>

Where it is in fact so acted upon by the other party, the promise would be binding on the party making it, and he would not be entitled to go back upon it, if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so, having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties. This would be so irrespective of whether there is any pre-existing relationship between the parties or not. (Para 115) </span>

Thus, a guarantee is a promise to answer for the payment of some debt, or the performance of some duty, in case of failure of another party, who is in the first instance, liable to such payment or performance . A guarantee is a security in the form of right of action against a third party. In order to constitute a guarantee there has to be a specific undertaking or unambiguous affirmation to discharge the liability of a third person in case of their default. A guarantee is governed by principles of construction generally governing other documents. A guarantee being a mercantile contract, the Court does not apply to it merely technical rules but construes it so as to reflect what may fairly be inferred to have been the parties’ real intention and understanding as expressed by them in writing and to give effect to it rather than not.

Article 21 of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime - Under the statutes such as PMLA, where maximum sentence is seven years, prolonged incarceration pending trial may warrant grant of bail by Constitutional Courts, if there is no likelihood of the trial concluding within a reasonable time. Statutory restrictions cannot be permitted to result in indefinite pretrial detention in violation of Article 21. Prolonged incarceration cannot be allowed to convert pretrial detention into punishment and that documentary evidence already seized by the prosecution eliminates the possibility of tampering with the same. The right to speedy trial, enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, is not eclipsed by the nature of the offence.  (Para 16-18)</span>

<span class="c3">Bail - Gravity of Offence -</span><span class="c6"> The court while dealing with the prayer for grant of bail has to consider gravity of offence, which has to be ascertained in the facts and circumstances of each case. One of the circumstances to consider the gravity of offences is also the term of sentence i.e., prescribed for the offence, the accused is alleged to have committed . The court has also to take into account the object of the special Act, the gravity of offence and the attending circumstances along with period of sentence. (Para 15)</span>

<span class="c3">Bail - Economic Offences</span><span class="c6">- All economic offences cannot be classified into one group as it may involve various activities and may differ from one case to another. Therefore, it is not advisable on the part of the Court to categorize all the offences into one group and deny bail on that basis . (Para 15)</span>

<span class="c3">Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 12(5)- </span><span class="c6">The ineligibility of an arbitrator can be waived only by an express agreement in writing. The requirement of the waiver to be made expressly in the form of agreement in writing ensures that parties are not divested of their right to object inadvertently or by procedural happenstance. (Para 89-90) A notice invoking the arbitration clause under Section 21, a procedural order, submission of statement of claim, the filing an application seeking interim relief, or a reply to an application under Section 33 cannot be countenanced to mean “an express agreement in writing” within the meaning of the proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 12.

<span class="c3">Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 12(5)-</span><span class="c6"> A challenge to an arbitrator’s ineligibility could be raised at any stage because an award passed in such circumstance is non-est, i.e., it carries no enforceability or recognition in law - When an arbitrator is found to be ineligible by virtue of Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule, his mandate is automatically terminated. In such circumstance, an aggrieved party may approach the court under Section 14 read with Section 15 for appointment of a substitute arbitrator. Whereas, when an award has been passed by such an arbitrator, an aggrieved party may approach the court under Section 34 for setting aside the award. (Para 123-iv)</span>

Such participation eliminates the likelihood of challenges to the arbitrator at a later stage. It is needless to say that independence and impartiality in arbitral proceedings would be served only when the parties participate equally at all stages - The principle of party autonomy does not obliterate the principle of equal treatment of the parties, either in the procedure for appointment of arbitrators or in the arbitral proceedings. The exercise of party autonomy has to be in consonance with the principles of equal treatment of parties, which impliedly include the independence and impartiality of arbitrators.

Section 21 is concerned only with determining the commencement of the dispute for the purpose of reckoning limitation. There is no mandatory prerequisite for issuance of a Section 21 notice prior to the commencement of Arbitration. Issuance of a Section 21 notice may come to the aid of parties and the arbitrator in determining the limitation for the claim.

<span class="c3">UAPA - Section 43D(5) - Propositions governing the application of Section 43D(5) -</span><span class="c6">First, the provision embodies a deliberate legislative departure from ordinary bail jurisprudence, premised upon the distinctive nature of offences under Chapters IV and VI of the Act. Second, the expression “prima facie true” mandates a threshold judicial inquiry which is neither perfunctory nor adjudicatory, requiring the Court to examine whether the prosecution material, taken at face value, discloses the essential statutory ingredients of the alleged offence. Third, the inquiry is necessarily accused specific, directed to the role and attribution qua the individual, and does not admit of collective or undifferentiated treatment merely because allegations arise from a common transaction or conspiracy. Fourth, the bail stage under Section 43D(5) is not a forum for evaluating defences, weighing evidence, or conducting a minitrial; judicial restraint at this stage is not an abdication of duty but a fulfilment of the statutory mandate. These propositions, read together, define the contours of judicial power and responsibility under the provision.he correct application of Section 43D(5), therefore, requires the Court to undertake a structured inquiry confined to the following: i. whether the prosecution material, accepted as it stands, discloses a prima facie case satisfying the statutory ingredients of the offence alleged; ii. whether the role attributed to the accused reflects a real and meaningful nexus to the unlawful activity or terrorist activity proscribed under the Act, as distinguished from mere association or peripheral presence; and iii. whether the statutory threshold is crossed qua the individual accused, without embarking upon an assessment reserved after fullfledged trial - Where these requirements are met, the statutory restraint on the grant of bail must operate with full force; where they are not, the embargo stands lifted. This approach preserves the legislative purpose of the Act, and ensures that the exceptional nature of the bail regime under Section 43D(5) is neither diluted by overreach nor distorted by mechanical application. (Para 81-82)</span>

<span class="c3">UAPA - Section 15 -</span><span class="c6"> “Terrorist act”- The means by which such acts may be committed are not confined to the use of bombs, explosives, firearms, or other conventional weapons alone - To construe Section 15 as limited only to conventional modes of violence would be to unduly narrow the provision, contrary to its plain language - Apart from death or destruction of property, the provision expressly encompasses acts which disrupt supplies or services essential to the life of the community, as well as acts which threaten the economic security of the nation. This reflects Parliament’s recognition that threats to sovereignty and security may arise through conduct that destabilises civic life or societal functioning, even in the absence of immediate physical violence - terrorist activity may involve multiple actors performing different roles towards a common unlawful objective. (Para 86-90)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 21 ; UAPA - Section 43D -</span><span class="c6"> In prosecutions alleging offences which implicate the sovereignty, integrity, or security of the State, delay does not operate as a trump card that automatically displaces statutory restraint. Rather, delay serves as a trigger for heightened judicial scrutiny. The outcome of such scrutiny must be determined by a proportional and contextual balancing of legally relevant considerations, including (i) the gravity and statutory character of the offence alleged, (ii) the role attributed to the accused within the alleged design or conspiracy, (iii) the strength of the prima facie case as it emerges at the limited threshold contemplated under the special statute, and (iv) the extent to which continued incarceration, viewed cumulatively in the facts of the case, has become demonstrably disproportionate so as to offend the guarantee of personal liberty under Article 21- Thus, when the composite evaluation yields a clear conclusion that continued detention has crossed the bounds of constitutional permissibility that the Court may justifiably intervene notwithstanding statutory restrictions. (Para 56-57)</span>

<span class="c3">UAPA - Section 43D(5) -</span><span class="c6"> The law does not require the prosecution to demonstrate, at the bail stage, that the accused personally caused death or destruction, or personally stocked explosives, before Section 43D(5) can apply. It requires the Court to see whether the material discloses a prima facie case of involvement in the unlawful activity alleged.  (Para 216)</span>

<span class="c3">UAPA</span><span class="c6"> - Not every disruption of traffic, not every blockade, and not every law-and-order incident engages the statutory framework of the UAPA. The statute is attracted only where the conduct alleged, taken cumulatively, is capable of being understood as threatening the unity, integrity, security, or sovereignty of the nation, or as creating a climate of fear and paralysis transcending ordinary disorder. (Para 227)</span>

<span class="c3">UAPA</span><span class="c6">- Gender, while not conferring immunity from criminal law, remains a relevant consideration in determining the necessity of continued pre-trial detention. - The law does not envisage incarceration as a measure of deterrence at the pre-trial stage, particularly where the individual concerned is a woman with no prior criminal antecedents and whose alleged actions stem from a ground-level facilitating role.</span>

<span class="c3">Factual Summary: Delhi Riots Case -</span><span class="c6"> Supreme Court declined bail to Sharjeel Imam and Umar Khalid for their alleged central, planning roles, but granted bail to Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa-ur-Rehman, Mohd. Saleem Khan, and Shadab Ahmed, whose roles were found operational and peripheral, subject to stringent conditions. The Court directed expedited trial, especially examination of protected witnesses, and allowed Imam and Khalid to renew bail after a year or completion of protected-witness testimony.</span>

The law cannot change with the change of the Bench. When a coordinate Bench of a High Court has already determined a question of law, a subsequent Bench of equal strength is bound to follow that view; if it doubts its correctness, the only permissible course is to refer the matter to a larger Bench.

The immunity of a fiscal notification from scrutiny is no greater than that of any other form of subordinate legislation. (Para 56)</span>

<span class="c3">Legislation - Taxation -</span><span class="c6"> A delegate cannot do indirectly what it has no authority to do directly. The power to exempt is not a power to tax. The two stand on opposite constitutional planes. The essential legislative function of imposing a tax or duty rests with Parliament and must be located in a charging provision.

(ii) Whether the introduction and operationalisation of “caste-based discrimination” under the Impugned Regulations would have any bearing on the existing constitutional and statutory sub-classification of the Most Backward Castes within the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, and whether the Impugned Regulations provide adequate and effective protection and safeguards to such Extremely Backward Castes against discrimination and structural disadvantage? (iii) Whether the inclusion of the expression “segregation” in Clause 7(d) of the Impugned Regulations, in the context of allocation of hostels, classrooms, mentorship groups, or similar academic or residential arrangements, albeit on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria, would amount to a “separate yet equal” classification, thereby infringing the constitutional guarantees of equality and fraternity under Articles 14, 15 as well as the Preamble to the Constitution of India? (iv) Whether the omission of the term “Ragging” as a specific form of discrimination in the framework of the Impugned Regulations, despite its existence in the University Grants Commission (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2012, constitutes a regressive and exclusionary legislative omission? If so, whether such 4 omission is violative of unequal treatment of victims of discrimination by creating an asymmetry in access to justice and thus falls foul of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India??</span>

This is based on the principle that although the employee was willing to perform work, it was the employer who did not accept work from him and, therefore, if the employer’s action is held to be illegal and bad, such employer cannot escape from suffering the consequences.

Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 154 : Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 - Section 173 : FIR On Social Media Posts - Supreme Court dismissed SLP filed against the judgment of Telangana High Court that had issued the following guidelines in cases where the registration of First Information Reports (FIRs) is sought in connection with social media posts: i. Verification of locus standi: Before registering any FIR for alleged defamation or similar offences, the police must verify whether the complainant qualifies as the "person aggrieved" in terms of law. Complaints by unrelated third parties lacking standing are not maintainable, except where the report concerns a cognizable offence. ii. Preliminary inquiry in cognizable offences: Where a representation/complaint discloses a cognizable offence, the police shall, prior to registration of crime, conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether the statutory ingredients of the alleged offence are, prima facie, made out. iii. High threshold for media post/speech-related offences: No case alleging promotion of enmity, intentional insult, public mischief, threat to public order, or sedition shall he registered unless there exists prima facie material disclosing incitement to violence, hatred, or public disorder. This threshold must be applied in line with the principles laid down in Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar, 1962 Supp (2) SCR 769, and Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, (2015) 5 SCC 1. iv. Protection of political speech/post: The police shall not mechanically register cases concerning harsh, offensive, or critical political speech. Only when the speech amounts to incitement to violence or poses an imminent threat to public order may criminal law be invoked. Constitutional protections for free political criticism under Article 19(l)(a) of the Constitution must be scrupulously enforced. v. Defamation as a non-cognizable offence: Since defamation is classified as a non-cognizable offence, the police cannot directly register an FIR or crime in such matters. The complainant must be directed to approach the jurisdictional Magistrate. Police action may follow only upon a specific order of the Magistrate under Section 174(2) of the BNSS. vi. Compliance with arrest guidelines: In all cases, the police shall strictly comply with the principles laid down in Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273. Automatic or mechanical arrests are impermissible, and the principle of proportionality in the exercise of criminal process must be observed. vii. Prior legal scrutiny in sensitive cases: In matters involving political speech/post or other sensitive forms of expression, the police shall obtain prior legal opinion from the Public Prosecutor before registering an FIR, to ensure that the proposed action is legally sustainable. viii. Frivolous or motivated complaints: Where a complaint is found to be frivolous, vexatious, or politically motivated, the police shall close the matter under Section 176(1) of the BNSS, citing absence of sufficient grounds for investigation.

(ii) Whether the introduction and operationalisation of “caste-based discrimination” under the Impugned Regulations would have any bearing on the existing constitutional and statutory sub-classification of the Most Backward Castes within the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, and whether the Impugned Regulations provide adequate and effective protection and safeguards to such Extremely Backward Castes against discrimination and structural disadvantage? (iii) Whether the inclusion of the expression “segregation” in Clause 7(d) of the Impugned Regulations, in the context of allocation of hostels, classrooms, mentorship groups, or similar academic or residential arrangements, albeit on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria, would amount to a “separate yet equal” classification, thereby infringing the constitutional guarantees of equality and fraternity under Articles 14, 15 as well as the Preamble to the Constitution of India? (iv) Whether the omission of the term “Ragging” as a specific form of discrimination in the framework of the Impugned Regulations, despite its existence in the University Grants Commission (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2012, constitutes a regressive and exclusionary legislative omission? If so, whether such 4 omission is violative of unequal treatment of victims of discrimination by creating an asymmetry in access to justice and thus falls foul of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India??</span>

<span class="c3">Motor Accident Compensation -</span><span class="c6"> Claimants claimed that deceased was cultivating land and involved in animal husbandry and milk vending - SC held: Even if the land which may be owned by the family is still subsisting the contribution of the male member of the family needs to be assessed. There is vast difference between the quality of contribution by a family member as compared to an employee. His working hours are not fixed. Any person who has an opportunity certainly tries to do as much work as he can do to support his family and also see that they live in comfort. Farming is not a regular vocation. The farmers remain engaged in doing animal husbandry and milk vending as well side by side, which also generates extra income for them - The income of the deceased can be increased from ₹5,000/- per month, as taken by the High Court, to ₹8,000/- per month. </span>

Though such a legislative policy is laudable, prima facie, it seems that this object can be kept intact while ensuring the land owners that they will be entitled to assessment of compensation for the acquired land in the same manner as is determined for the land owners whose lands are acquired under the Old Act or under the New Act, even when such acquisition is also for infrastructural development - </span><span class="c3">Suggestion</span><span class="c6">: Union of India should revisit the legislative scheme and consider the desirability of bringing parity in the matter of providing a mechanism for the determination of the market value of acquired land with reference to Article 300-A of the Constitution of India.

In a regular employment, directly made by the said State entity, there are safeguards to ensure that the system of employment/engagement is transparent and fulfills a minimum criteria and is open to all eligible persons and a mode/procedure is adopted for ultimately choosing the right person. When employees/workmen are taken through a contractor, it is the absolute discretion of the contractor as to whom and through which mode he would choose such persons to be sent to the principal- If the persons who are employed through a contractor, and have come to work, are given equal benefit and status as a regular employee, it would amount to giving premium and sanction to a process which is totally arbitrary as there is no mode prescribed in any contract as to how the contractor would employ or choose the persons who are to be sent, except for the basic qualification, i.e., knowledge in the field for which they are required.

Thus, the allegations must reveal that abuses were laced with caste name, or the caste name had been hurled as an abuse- The element of humiliation is present in Section 3(1)(s) as well. It has to be gathered from the intentional insult towards the caste, and the content. The content under Section 3(1)(s) are the abuses hurled at a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.

State of U.P. 2026 INSC 144 - Bail - Disclosure Of All Material Particulars - Guidelines</a></span>

### <span class="c21">Bail</span><span class="c9"> - Every petitioner or applicant seeking bail, at any stage of proceedings, is under an obligation to disclose all material particulars, including criminal antecedents and the existence of any coercive processes such as issuance of non-bailable warrants, declaration as a proclaimed offender, or similar proceedings, duly supported by an affidavit, so as to promote uniformity, transparency and integrity in bail adjudication- the following illustrative disclosure framework is provided, which is purely recommendatory in nature, A) CASE DETAILS • FIR Number & Date • Police Station, District and State • Sections invoked • Maximum punishment prescribed (B) CUSTODY & PROCEDURAL COMPLIANCE • Date of Arrest • Total period of custody undergone (C) STATUS OF TRIAL • Stage of proceedings (Investigation / Chargesheet / Cognizance / Framing of charges / Trial) • Total number of witnesses cited in the chargesheet • Number of prosecution witnesses examined (D) CRIMINAL ANTECEDENTS • FIR No. & Police Station • Sections • Status (Pending / Acquitted/ Convicted) (E) PREVIOUS BAIL APPLICATIONS • Court • Case No. • Outcome of case (F) COERCIVE PROCESSES • Whether any Non-Bailable Warrant was issued • Whether declared a proclaimed offender. (Para 48-49)</span>

### <span class="c21">Bail</span><span class="c9"> - The distinction between an appeal against an order granting bail and an application seeking cancellation of bail founded on postbail conduct or supervening circumstances. In an appeal against the grant of bail, the focus of judicial scrutiny is the legality, propriety, and sustainability of the bail order as it stood at the time of its grant. Where such an order is shown to suffer from non-application of mind, reliance on disputed or prima facie suspect material forming the subject-matter of trial, suppression or non-consideration of material facts, or disregard of binding legal principles, annulment of the bail order is not only permissible but warranted in order to avert a miscarriage of justice. (Para 18) Where a bail order is demonstrated to be legally untenable or fundamentally perverse, interference by the appellate court is not an exception, but a judicial imperative. Such interference does not trench upon the sanctity of personal liberty. (Para 19)</span>

### <span class="c21">Impersonation as Advocate -</span><span class="c9">Impersonation as a legal professional and the use of forged credentials before courts, which have serious public and institutional ramification.</span>

(Para 12) \[Context: The Supreme Court upheld the High Court judgment holding that employees of Heavy Water Plant, Tuticorin (HWP) are not covered by the definition of Section 2(e) of the PG Act\]</span>

### <span class="c21">Jurisdictional Fact -</span><span class="c9"> A jurisdictional fact is a fact which must exist before a court, tribunal, or authority assumes jurisdiction over a particular matter. A jurisdictional fact is one on the existence or non-existence of which depends the jurisdiction of a court, a tribunal or an authority. It is the fact upon which an administrative agency’s power to act depends. If the jurisdictional fact does not exist, the court, authority or officer cannot act. If a court or authority wrongly assumes the existence of such a fact, the order  can be questioned by a writ of certiorari. The underlying principle is that by erroneously assuming the existence of such a jurisdictional fact, no authority can confer upon itself jurisdiction which it otherwise does not possess. (Para 10)</span>

### <span class="c21">Interpretation of Statutes -</span><span class="c9"> Coupling the word “means” with “includes” denotes an exhaustive definition. Conversely, the word “means” and “does not include” should be read as exclusionary language that strictly excludes the scope of the provision from certain classes. (Para 12)</span>

### <span class="c21">Precedent -</span><span class="c9"> A decision is an authority for what it decides and not what can be logically deduced therefrom. (Para 11)</span>

However, where the findings are based on no evidence a court of law is perfectly justified in interfering with the orders in disciplinary proceedings -if the findings in the enquiry report are perverse and not supported by the evidence on record, the Court in judicial review can interfere. (Para 43)</span>

State of Madhya Pradesh 2026 INSC 141 - S.14A SC-ST Act - BNSS/CrPC - Discharge</a></span>

### <span class="c21">Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (SC-ST Act) - Section 14A :</span><span class="c9"> Orders framing charge or refusing discharge are neither interlocutory nor final, but an appeal thereagainst would fall under Section 14-A (Para 17) - The provision does not curtail or dilute the ordinary appellate powers of the High Court. Consequently, the High Court does not function as a revisional or supervisory Court while exercising jurisdiction under Section 14-A but assumes the role of a first appellate court. A mechanical affirmation of the order of the Special Court, without independent scrutiny, would therefore be inconsistent with settled appellate jurisprudence and would amount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction. Even where the appellate Court ultimately agrees with the reasoning of the Courts below, the judgment must disclose that the material was independently examined- The appellate power under Section 14-A of the SC/ST Act must be exercised in harmony with the broader framework of criminal procedure. While the High Court is dutybound, as a first appellate Court, to independently apply its mind and correct errors committed by the Special Court, it must remain conscious of the stage of the proceedings and the corresponding limits of judicial scrutiny.(Para 19)</span>

### <span class="c21">Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - Sections 227, 228 - Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 - Sections 250,251 :</span><span class="c9"> At the stage of framing of charge or considering discharge, the Court is not dealing with an abstract legal exercise. It is dealing with real people, real anxieties, and the real weight of criminal prosecution. Judicial responsibility at this stage calls for care, balance, and an honest engagement with the facts on record. The power to frame a charge is not meant to be exercised by default or out of caution alone. When the material placed before the Court, taken at face value, does not disclose the ingredients of an offence, the law expects the Court to have the clarity and courage to say so and to keep such a case aside. Discharge, in that sense, is not a technical indulgence but an essential safeguard. The Court must consciously distinguish between a genuine case that warrants a trial and one that rests only on suspicion or assumption or for that matter without any basis. To allow a matter to proceed despite the absence of a prima facie case is to expose a person to the strain, stigma, and uncertainty of criminal proceedings without legal necessity. Fidelity to the rule of law requires the Court to remember that the process itself can become the punishment if this responsibility is not exercised with care. (Para 20)</span>

### <span class="c21">Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 - Section 250,251 : Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - 227, 228 :</span><span class="c9"> What the BNSS does is to change the procedural setting within which this discretion is exercised. The new statute introduces express timelines for the filing of discharge applications and for the framing of charges, and it expressly recognises the possibility of the accused being heard or examined through electronic means. These changes are regulatory in nature. They are aimed at structuring the process and reducing delay, not at transforming the judicial task itself. The Court’s obligation to apply its mind to the record, to hear both sides, and to record reasons where discharge is ordered remains exactly as before, as does the caution against weighing evidence or conducting a mini trial at these preliminary stages - The established jurisprudence developed under the Cr.P.C. on the scope and limits of consideration at the stages of discharge and framing of charge continues to hold the field under the BNSS. (Para 11)</span>

### <span class="c21">Trial Courts -</span><span class="c9"> Trial Courts, which are the first courts most people ever step into. For a litigant or an accused, the Trial Court is not just one level in a hierarchy. It represents the face of the judiciary itself. The sensitivity, fairness, and legal discipline shown at this stage shape how ordinary citizens understand justice. The impression a Trial Court creates, through its approach to facts and law, often becomes the impression people carry of the entire judicial system. That is why, at every stage and especially at the threshold, Trial Courts must remain alive to the human consequences of their decisions and to the trust that society places in them.(Para 21)</span>

### <span class="c21">SC– ST Act -Section 3(1)(r) 3(1)(s) and 3(2)(va) :</span><span class="c9"> The accused must first commit an offence under the IPC, such as assault, robbery, or any other crime punishable with ten or more years of imprisonment. The act must be directed against a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, or against property that belongs to them, reflecting the special protection the law affords to historically marginalized communities. In addition, the accused must have knowledge that the victim belongs to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe or that the property belongs to such a person. This requirement of awareness is essential to the application of the law. Finally, the punishment prescribed under this sub-section is life imprisonment along with a fine, underscoring the gravity of offences committed against vulnerable communities. Section 3(2)(va)  : To attract liability under this provision, the accused must commit one of the scheduled offences against a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe or their property. The offender must know the caste identity of the victim or that the property belongs to them, ensuring that the law applies to deliberate acts of caste-based harm. (Para 10)</span>

### <span class="c21">SC– ST Act -</span><span class="c9"> The Act is a transformative instrument, bridging the gap between constitutional ideals and everyday realities, ensuring that SC/ST citizens can live as equal, dignified, and empowered members of society. (Para 9)</span>

The Court directed the National Medical Commission and the State of Madhya Pradesh to ensure that he is granted MBBS admission in a private medical college strictly according to his EWS rank 164 for the 2025–2026 session, subject to payment of the prescribed EWS fee, within one week.</span>

Among the miscellaneous matters, nothing can be more important than deciding the fate of an application for bail – if people continue to languish in jails, their bail applications are not being heard, and there is an air of uncertainty surrounding when they will get to know the fate of their applications, we believe that this Court is under a bounden duty to lay down certain mandatory guidelines- High Courts to send complete details of the anticipatory bail/regular bail/suspension of sentence applications pending in the respective High Courts, along with the date of filing, date of decision, or the next date of hearing- All the State Governments are directed to fully cooperate with the High Courts for early and time-bound adjudication of the bail applications/prayer for suspension of sentence.

### <span class="c3">Environmental Law -</span><span class="c19"> Environmental protection must be pursued through lawful means. The mandate to clear the encroachments from the forest land does not authorise an arbitrary action. The Constitution does not envisage a choice between environmental protection and the rule of law, rather, it insists that both co-exist and reinforce each other. (Para 10) \[</span><span class="c3">Context</span><span class="c11">: This case concerns with large-scale eviction notices issued to long-settled villagers residing inside various reserved forests in Assam, challenging those notices as arbitrary and violative of natural justice\]</span>

### <span class="c3">Constitution of India -</span><span class="c19"> The Constitution casts a clear and unequivocal obligation upon the state to protect forest and the environment.- Article 48A- Article 48A, forming part of Directive Principles of State Policy, mandates that the State shall endeavor to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country. Though, Directive Principles are not enforceable by Courts, they are fundamental in governance of the country and must guide the State in formulation and implementation of policy- </span><span class="c3">Article 51A(g) -</span><span class="c11"> Fundamental duty upon every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment, including forests. These constitutional provision reflect a collective responsibility on the part of citizen as well as the State to prevent, regulate and remedy the environmental harm.(Para 9)</span>

### <span class="c3">Forests</span><span class="c11"> - Forests constitute one of the most vital natural resources of the nation. They are not merely repositories of timber or land capable of alternate use, but complex ecological systems indispensable for maintaining environmental balance. Forests regulate climate, preserve biodiversity, recharge groundwater, prevent soil erosion, and act as natural carbon sinks mitigating the adverse effects of climate 8 change. In a country as ecologically diverse and climatically vulnerable as India, the role of forests assumes even greater significance. Encroachment upon forest land has emerged as one of the gravest challenges confronting environmental governance in the country. (Para 9)</span>

<span class="c3">Indian Evidence Act 1872 - Section 65 - </span><span class="c6">Primary evidence is the rule, while secondary evidence is an exception admissible only in the absence of primary evidence. A party is generally required to produce the best evidence available; so long as the superior evidence (the original) is within a party's possession or reach, they cannot introduce inferior proof (secondary evidence). (Para 20.1) - The introduction of secondary evidence is a two-step process, wherein, first, the party must establish the legal right to lead secondary evidence, and second, they must prove the contents of the documents through that evidence. The twin requirements are conjunctive (Para 21) -There is no requirement that an application must be filed to lead secondary evidence. While a party may choose to file such an application, secondary evidence cannot be ousted solely because no application was filed. It is sufficient if the party lays the necessary factual foundation for leading secondary evidence either in the pleadings or during the course of evidence. (Para 20.7)</span>

<span class="c3">Indian Evidence Act 1872 - Section 85</span><span class="c6">- In the absence of an original or at least a secondary evidence, it is impermissible to apply Section 85 of the Indian Evidence Act to conclude the execution of document - A photocopy of a document is no evidence unless the same is proved by following the procedure set out. (Para 23)</span>

<span class="c3">Indian Evidence Act 1872 - </span><span class="c6">Courts should not by itself compare disputed signatures without the assistance of any expert, when the signatures with which the disputed signatures compared, are themselves not the admitted signatures. (Para 23)</span>

<span class="c3">Code of Civil Procedure 1908 - Section 100,103 - Second Appeal -</span><span class="c6"> The general rule is that findings of fact recorded by the trial and appellate courts are binding and will not be disturbed, even if they appear to be erroneous- However, this restriction is not absolute. Where the findings of fact are founded on assumptions, conjectures or surmises, or suffer from the vice of perversity, the High Court is well within its jurisdiction to interfere with findings of fact. The legality of a finding of fact, when challenged on the ground of perversity, itself constitutes a question of law and, therefore, may give rise to a substantial question of law under Section 100. finding may be termed perverse where it is arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant and material evidence, by considering irrelevant material, or where it is based on no evidence or on wholly unreliable evidence. A decision based on no evidence is not confined to cases of complete absence of evidence, but also includes cases where the evidence on record, taken as a whole, is incapable of reasonably supporting the findings recorded. A finding that outrageously defies logic, suffers from irrationality, or is such that no reasonable person acting judicially could have arrived at it, is equally perverse in the eye of the law. Findings resting on the ipse dixit of the court or on conjecture and surmises reflect non-application of mind and stand vitiated on that ground as well - Insofar as documentary evidence is concerned, an inference drawn from the contents of a document is ordinarily a question of fact. However, the legal effect of a document's terms, its construction involving the application of legal principles, or a misconstruction thereof gives rise to a question of law (Para 16) The power under Section 103 CPC can be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and with circumspection. Before invoking this provision, the High Court must record a clear finding that the findings of fact recorded by the courts below are vitiated by perversity. In the absence of such a categorical finding, the exercise of power under Section 103 would fall outside the permissible limits of Section 100 of the CPC. (Para 16.7)</span>

A review of a judgment is a drastic step, and a reluctant resort to it is proper only where a glaring omission or patent mistake or a grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility.

<span class="c3">Motor Accident Compensation </span><span class="c6">- The non-pecuniary loss arising from deprivation of love and affection is comprehended within the broader head of “consortium”. Consequently, no separate award under the head of loss of love and affection is warranted. \[But opined: The head of “future prospects” itself is a creation of judicial interpretation, evolved to respond to socioeconomic realities and the legitimate expectations of dependents. If the law is capable of recognising anticipated economic progression as a valid loss, it is not too clear why emotional deprivation manifested in loss of love and affection must be viewed as an impermissible head\]</span>

<span class="c3">Motor Accident Compensation </span><span class="c6">-The concept of future prospects is an integral component of “just compensation” and is not confined only to those in permanent government employment.  Where the deceased was self-employed or on a fixed salary and below the age of 40 years, an addition of 40% of the established income towards future prospects is compulsory. (Para 18) </span>

<span class="c3">Motor Accident Compensation</span><span class="c6"> - The amount of compensation should be “just”, i.e., it implies that the determination is fair, reasonable and equitable by accepted legal standards and is not a bonanza. Though “just” compensation can never be prefect or absolute compensation, since loss of human life can never be compensated by monetary terms, the principle of awarding “just” compensation and assessing the extent of dependency would depend on examination of the unique situation of each individual case. The determination of income must be founded on proof placed on record and cannot rest on conjecture or assumptions divorced from evidence. (Para 12-16)</span>

What is required is a clear and unequivocal intention to sever the joint status. In the absence of any declaration or conduct evidencing an intention to divide, the inference of continued joint family status was inevitable. (Para 32) proof of the mere existence of a joint family does not by itself render all properties as joint family properties, but equally, once it is established that ancestral properties yielding income existed and acquisitions were made during the continuance of the joint family, the burden shifts to the person asserting self-acquisition. (Para 29) Hindu law does not require other coparceners to establish with precision the exact source of funds for each acquisition made by the Karta. Where acquisitions are made during the subsistence of the joint family, and where ancestral properties yielding income are shown to exist, properties acquired in the name of the Karta are ordinarily regarded as joint family properties unless the contrary is proved.

Such genuine cases that deserve prosecution of the accused must be clearly demarcated from the litigation that arises from the cases of consensual relationships between consenting adults going acrimonious on account of dispute and disagreement or a future change of mind - The expression “repeatedly” contemplates more than one act of sexual assault, committed at different points in time on the same victim - This means a series of acts that are separate in nature and not a continuation of a single transaction. In genuine cases under Section 376(2)(n) of the IPC, the pattern is usually unmistakable; it is an initial act of sexual assault, followed by multiple acts under fear, pressure, captivity, or continued deceit, often when the woman is rendered vulnerable and unable to escape the situation.

Kishan Subhash Rathod  2026 INSC 122 - S.10 Industrial Disputes Act - CLRA</a></span>

<span class="c3">Industrial Disputes Act - Section 2 -Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970 - Section 2 - </span><span class="c6">Though the definition of “workman” under Section 2(1)(i) of the CLRA is textually derived from Section 2(s) of the ID Act, 1947, the two differ fundamentally in their juridical scope and the structural basis of the employment between employer and employee. The definition under ID Act is broad, which includes persons dismissed, discharged, or retrenched in connection with an industrial dispute to ensure they retain locus standi for adjudication. The CLRA, being regulatory in nature, contains no such “extended meaning” for terminated employees. Furthermore, the CLRA introduces a specific statutory exclusion for “out-workers” whereas the ID Act does not have this specific statutory exclusion. Under the ID Act, the status of such workers is determined by the “Control and Supervision Test”. If the employer controls how the work is done, they may still be workmen under ID Act, even if working off-site. Under CLRA, they are statutorily barred from the definition. Finally, the ID Act presupposes a direct privity of contract (masterservant relationship) between the management and the worker, whereas the CLRA definition strictly operates through the medium of a contractor, covering workers hired “by or through” a third party for the establishment’s work. (Para 9)</span>

<span class="c3">Industrial Disputes Act - Section 10 -</span><span class="c19"> If a case falls within the second limb or Section 10(1) of the ID Act, the appropriate Government is within its jurisdiction to refer an apprehended dispute to the Labour Court. By applying the same rule of interpretation, it can be construed that the appropriate Government may refer an Industrial Dispute apprehended to the Board, Labour Court and Tribunal. (Para 34) Even if an unfair labour practice is alleged, the applicable statute is the ID Act and the forum, the labour court. In the case of sham and nominal contracts, adjudicatory reliefs of the status of workman vis-à-vis the principal employer are a sine qua non for any other relief. (Para 36) </span><span class="c3">Remedies Available if Notification Under Section 10(1) is Issued for Abolition of Contract Labour:</span><span class="c19"> (1)The issuance of a Section 10 notification does not lead to the automatic absorption of contract workers as regular employees of the principal employer. (2) The immediate legal effect of such abolition is that the contract labour working in that specific process must cease to function in that capacity. The principal employer is prohibited from employing contract labour for that job thereafter. (3) The workers do not become unemployed immediately; they remain employees of the contractor. The contractor can utilize their services in any other establishment where contract labour is not prohibited-</span><span class="c3">Remedies Available if the Contract is Continued as a “Camouflage” (Sham Contract):</span><span class="c19"> (1) If it is proved that the contract was a mere ruse or camouflage to hide the real employer-employee relationship and that the principal employer retained full control and supervision over the workers the contract is disregarded as a legal fiction (2) In such cases, workmen “will have to be treated as employees of the principal employer who shall be directed to regularise the services of the contract labour”. Unlike the Section 10 scenario, here the workers become direct employees of the company. They are entitled to back wages and benefits as if they were regular employees from the start (or a date determined by the Tribunal).(3) Determining whether a contract is “sham” or “genuine” involves disputed questions of fact (e.g., Who supervised the work? Who paid the wages? Who supplied the tools?). Therefore, only the Industrial Tribunal/Court can adjudicate the dispute. Writ Courts generally do not decide these disputed questions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. (Para 10.2.3)  </span><span class="c3">Modes and Methods of re-employment if discontinuation of the contract is valid </span><span class="c6">: If the principal employer intends to employ regular workmen for the work previously done by contract labour, they must give preference to the erstwhile contract labourers. (2) The principal employer cannot simply hire fresh candidates from the open market while ignoring the displaced contract workers. They are legally bound to consider the contract workers who were working in that establishment. (3) To ensure this "preference" is meaningful, the principal employer may relax maximum age limit and academic qualifications; specifically, nontechnical posts to accommodate experienced workers-</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 227 ; Code of Civil Procedure - Order VII Rule 11: </span><span class="c6">Once the specific provision under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC, is available, the High Court cannot exercise powers under Article 227 to reject or strike off the plaint. For such relief, the specific provision under Order VII Rule 11, CPC, will have to be resorted to, on the grounds mentioned in the said provision. (Para 7.4) . Availability of an alternative civil remedy and/or under the CPC shall be treated as complete and near total bar on the High Court to venture to invoke and exercise its power available under Article 227 of the Constitution, except where exercise of supervisory jurisdiction becomes absolutely necessary. (Para 9)</span>

<span class="c3">Order VI Rule 16 - Order VII Rule 11 -</span><span class="c6"> Order VI Rule 16 deals with the striking out of a part or a section of the pleading which suffers from any of the kinds mentioned in the provision, such as unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous, vexatious, prejudicial, embarrassing or delaying the fair trial or abuse of the process of law. It would be stretching beyond the logic of law to interpret and imply that Order VI Rule 16 can be utilized and employed for striking down the entire plaint. Striking down the plaint or rejection of plaint on the legal grounds available in Order VII Rule 11, CPC is entirely different than striking out the infirm or abusive pleadings. (Para 6.4.1)</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226,227 -</span><span class="c6"> The availability of alternative remedy shall be legitimately construed to displace the exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction by the High Court, is true not only for the purpose of exercising powers under Article 226 of the Constitution but also for the purpose of invoking Article 227 of the Constitution.

(Para 54) \[</span><span class="c3">Context</span><span class="c6">: In this case, SC held that any action of the State/Union Government to employ instructors/teachers on a fixed honorarium of Rs.7,000/- per month as was initially fixed in 2013-14 amounts to ‘Begar’ and unfair practice which is violative of Article 23 of the Constitution \]</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226</span><span class="c6">- The existence of an alternative remedy under a statutory scheme does not operate as an absolute bar to the exercise of writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. This is particularly so in cases where the writ petition has already been entertained by the Court, pleadings have been completed, and the matter has been adjudicated on merits. In such circumstances, relegating the parties to an alternative forum would defeat the ends of justice and render the prior proceedings redundant - where the facts so justify, the Court retains full discretion to entertain and decide a writ petition notwithstanding the availability of an alternative remedy. (Para 29-30)</span>

(Para 38)</span><span class="c3">\[Context</span><span class="c6">: SC held that part time contractual instructors/teachers appointed in the Upper Primary School in the State of U.P. are entitled to revision of their honorarium of Rs.7,000/- per month which was initially fixed for the contract period of eleven months in the year 2013 and that the said revision has to take place, if not annually then periodically as per the discretion of the PAB. Since the PAB for the year 2017-18 had determined the said honorarium to be Rs.17,000/- per month, all instructors/teachers appointed under the scheme are entitled for the payment of the same at the above rate of Rs.17,000/- per month with effect from 2017-18 till further revision takes place.\]</span>

The Court will also take into account other factors such as reduction of the fee of the arbitrator under proviso to Section 29A(4) and also impose costs on parties if the fact situation so demands. Substitution is an option for the Court as the provision itself says, “it shall be open for the Court to substitute”, and it will be exercised carefully.

The Supreme Court had earlier stayed the High Court’s judgment on 05.09.2016, and by the time of final hearing the 2012–2017 assembly term had already expired. In these circumstances, without examining the merits of the election dispute, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal in part by setting aside the adverse observations and directions contained in the High Court’s judgment.</span>

<span class="c3">Constitution of India - Article 226, 243O</span><span class="c19">- By virtue of the express constitutional embargo contained in Article 243-O of the Constitution of India, the High Court is precluded from exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution where a law enacted by the State Legislature provides for the remedy of an election petition to redress grievances arising during the course of an election. The election process cannot be lightly interdicted or stalled at the behest of an individual grievance. The right to contest or question an election being statutory in nature, must be strictly construed and exercised in accordance with the statute governing the field. The High Court must, therefore, eschew the grant of liberal interim reliefs in favour of individuals and instead remain mindful of the overarching public interest in ensuring the smooth and uninterrupted conduct of elections across the State. In respect of individual grievances, the ultimate and exclusive remedy lies by way of an election petition. Given the non-obstante nature of Article 243-O of the Constitution, its mandate is required to be adhered to in both letter and spirit. Where the statute provides a complete and efficacious mechanism for redressal, the extraordinary exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution would defeat the very object for which Article 243-O was enacted as a non-obstante provision.

<span class="c6">Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 154 : Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 - Section 173 : FIR On Social Media Posts - Supreme Court dismissed SLP filed against the judgment of Telangana High Court that had issued the following guidelines in cases where the registration of First Information Reports (FIRs) is sought in connection with social media posts: i. Verification of locus standi: Before registering any FIR for alleged defamation or similar offences, the police must verify whether the complainant qualifies as the "person aggrieved" in terms of law. Complaints by unrelated third parties lacking standing are not maintainable, except where the report concerns a cognizable offence. ii. Preliminary inquiry in cognizable offences: Where a representation/complaint discloses a cognizable offence, the police shall, prior to registration of crime, conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether the statutory ingredients of the alleged offence are, prima facie, made out. iii. High threshold for media post/speech-related offences: No case alleging promotion of enmity, intentional insult, public mischief, threat to public order, or sedition shall he registered unless there exists prima facie material disclosing incitement to violence, hatred, or public disorder. This threshold must be applied in line with the principles laid down in Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar, 1962 Supp (2) SCR 769, and Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, (2015) 5 SCC 1. iv. Protection of political speech/post: The police shall not mechanically register cases concerning harsh, offensive, or critical political speech. Only when the speech amounts to incitement to violence or poses an imminent threat to public order may criminal law be invoked. Constitutional protections for free political criticism under Article 19(l)(a) of the Constitution must be scrupulously enforced. v. Defamation as a non-cognizable offence: Since defamation is classified as a non-cognizable offence, the police cannot directly register an FIR or crime in such matters. The complainant must be directed to approach the jurisdictional Magistrate. Police action may follow only upon a specific order of the Magistrate under Section 174(2) of the BNSS. vi. Compliance with arrest guidelines: In all cases, the police shall strictly comply with the principles laid down in Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273. Automatic or mechanical arrests are impermissible, and the principle of proportionality in the exercise of criminal process must be observed. vii. Prior legal scrutiny in sensitive cases: In matters involving political speech/post or other sensitive forms of expression, the police shall obtain prior legal opinion from the Public Prosecutor before registering an FIR, to ensure that the proposed action is legally sustainable. viii. Frivolous or motivated complaints: Where a complaint is found to be frivolous, vexatious, or politically motivated, the police shall close the matter under Section 176(1) of the BNSS, citing absence of sufficient grounds for investigation.</span>

On this reasoning, the Court set aside the High Court’s direction to appoint the respondent from the waiting list and allowed the State’s appeal -By use of word ‘can’ in place of ‘shall’, the legislature /the rule making authority has left a degree of discretion with the Commission to recommend or not to recommend from the wait list in the given eventuality.
