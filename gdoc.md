<span class="c5 c11"></span>

<span class="c13">Indian Penal Code 1860 - Section 80,108 -Bail - </span><span class="c9">The accused, a dentist, was charged under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and the Dowry Prohibition Act in connection with the death of his wife, an anaesthetist - Allowing appeal, SC granted bail noticing that (1) FIR was originally for abetment of suicide based on alleged extra‑marital relationship, (2) the initial witness statements did not mention dowry demand, that the injuries did not appear to be the direct cause of death, (3) the deceased likely died due to Atracurium Besylate Injection, a drug she was professionally familiar with (4) the lack of hardened criminal background, (5) his custody since 25.03.2025.</span>

<span class="c5 c11"></span>

<span class="c13">Motor Accident Compensation -</span><span class="c9"> Claimants claimed that deceased was cultivating land and involved in animal husbandry and milk vending - SC held: Even if the land which may be owned by the family is still subsisting the contribution of the male member of the family needs to be assessed. There is vast difference between the quality of contribution by a family member as compared to an employee. His working hours are not fixed. Any person who has an opportunity certainly tries to do as much work as he can do to support his family and also see that they live in comfort. Farming is not a regular vocation. The farmers remain engaged in doing animal husbandry and milk vending as well side by side, which also generates extra income for them - The income of the deceased can be increased from ₹5,000/- per month, as taken by the High Court, to ₹8,000/- per month. </span>

Other than very extreme cases, the high courts ought to exercise restraint and not issue such directions which foreclose the discretion of the executive. \[</span><span class="c13">Context</span><span class="c9">: The appellant had filed a writ petition before the Madras High Court seeking action on his complaints alleging abuse of power and false cases by the police, but the High Court, while dismissing the writ, went on to direct the police to file charge‑sheets in pending cases within four months and the trial courts to complete trials within six months - In Appeal, set aside this direction issued by the High Court.\]</span>

Many experts believe that Blockchain, a shared, digital record book (ledger) system would ensure that once a transaction of a sale or mortgage or like nature is recorded, it becomes immutable and cryptographically secured- Such reforms are essential to minimize the scourge of forgery and "clever drafting" that clogs our judicial system. Registered documents must inspire absolute confidence to ensure the ease of doing business and to uphold the sanctity of property titles in a modern economy. (Para 76-77)</span>

(Para 34)</span>

### <span class="c10">Registration</span><span class="c2"> - Registered documents must inspire certainty; they cannot be rendered precarious by frivolous litigation- caution against the growing tendency to challenge registered instruments ‘at the drop of a hat'. (Para 33)</span>

(Para 48-49)</span>

### <span class="c10">Indian Contract Act, 1872 - Section 25 -</span><span class="c2"> Mere allegation of inadequacy of consideration does not make the Deed void. It is only in the absence of sale consideration being tendered that the sale deed would be void. (Para 60)</span>

### <span class="c10">Revenue Entries - </span><span class="c2">Revenue entries in the municipal records do not prove ownership. (Para 63)</span>

### <span class="c10">Registration - Reforms -</span><span class="c2"> Urgent need for the digitization of registered documents and land records using secure, tamper-proof technologies such as Blockchain. Many experts believe that Blockchain, a shared, digital record book (ledger) system would ensure that once a transaction of a sale or mortgage or like nature is recorded, it becomes immutable and cryptographically secured- Such reforms are essential to minimize the scourge of forgery and "clever drafting" that clogs our judicial system. Registered documents must inspire absolute confidence to ensure the ease of doing business and to uphold the sanctity of property titles in a modern economy. (Para 76-77)</span>

### <span class="c10">Matrimonial Matters -</span><span class="c2"> Warring couples cannot be allowed to settle their scores by treating Courts as their battlefield and choke the system. If there is no compatibility, there are modes available for early resolution of disputes. Process of mediation is the mode which can be explored at the stage of pre-litigation and even after litigation starts. When the parties start litigating against each other, especially on criminal side, the chances of reunion are remote but should not be ruled out. (Para 21) First and the foremost, earnest effort should be made by the parties and to be guided by the advocates, whensoever consulted in the process, is to convince them for a pre-litigation mediation. Rather in some cases, their counselling may be required - Even if a case is filed in a Court on a trivial issue such as maintenance under Section 144 of BNSS, 2023 (earlier Section 125 of CrPC, 1973) or Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the first effort required to be made by the Court is to explore mediation instead of calling upon the parties for filing replies as allegations and counter allegations sometimes aggravate the dispute. Even when a complaint is sought to be registered with the police of simple matrimonial dispute, first and the foremost effort has to be for re-conciliation, that too, if possible, through the mediation centers in the Courts, instead of calling the parties to the police stations. This sometimes becomes a point of no return specially when any of the parties is arrested, may it be even for a day. (Para 24) It is the duty of all concerned including the family members of the parties to make their earnest effort to resolve the disputes before any civil or criminal proceedings are launched.(Para 25)</span>

Public auction also ensures fairness in actions of the public authorities and their officers who should act fairly and objectively. Their actions should be legitimate.

Qualifications are prescribed keeping in view the needs and interests of an institution, an industry or an establishment, as the case may be. Similarly, equivalence of a qualification is not a matter which can be determined in exercise of the power of judicial review. Whether a particular qualification should or should not be regarded as equivalent is a matter for the State, as the recruiting authority, to determine. The assessment of the expediency, advisability or utility of such prescription of qualifications do not warrant intervention of the Courts unless the same are shown to be perverse.

The scope of judicial review in matters of public employment does not extend to questioning the State’s wisdom or policy in prescribing the minimum eligibility requirements for a public post. Qualifications are prescribed keeping in view the needs and interests of an institution, an industry or an establishment, as the case may be. Similarly, equivalence of a qualification is not a matter which can be determined in exercise of the power of judicial review. Whether a particular qualification should or should not be regarded as equivalent is a matter for the State, as the recruiting authority, to determine. The assessment of the expediency, advisability or utility of such prescription of qualifications do not warrant intervention of the Courts unless the same are shown to be perverse.

(Para 45) If an order has been passed to the prejudice or detriment of a suitor and such suitor seeks to have the order declared invalid and quashed in writ proceedings, it is imperative that he lays the order to a challenge, makes specific averments and urges cogent legal grounds to demonstrate its invalidity to enable him claim relief based thereon.

Yati Jain ; 2026 INSC 64 - Waiting List - Writ Appeal -LPA</a></span>

<span class="c1">Service Law - Waiting List -</span><span class="c7"> The key aspects of a waiting list, in relation to service law disputes: (i) a waiting list is normally prepared after the select/merit list is drawn; (ii) it would include candidates who have qualified the recruitment examination but are not so meritorious such that they can be immediately appointed on the number of vacancies advertised; (iii) such list would operate like a merit-based queue for vacancies that remain unfilled after offers of appointment given to the candidates in the select/merit list are not accepted; (iv) a waiting list has a limited validity period; (v) validity period of a waiting list depends on the recruitment rules and should no such period be mentioned, it can bona fide be operated till the next advertisement is issued without, however, violating provisions in such rules, if any, requiring recruitment process to be initiated either semi-annually or annually; and (vi) an opportunity to a candidate in the waiting list for securing appointment arises only when vacancies remain unfilled after the process of appointing candidates from the select/merit list is over and hence, it is regarded as a procedural outcome which is part of a structured process rather than a fortuitous circumstance- A wait-listed candidate has no right of appointment, much less an indefeasible right, except when the governing recruitment rules permit a small window authorizing appointments therefrom in the specified exceptional circumstances and the appointing authority, for no good reason, denies or refuses an appointment or the reason assigned therefor is found to be arbitrary and/or discriminatory and that too, when the waiting list has not expired.  (Para 86-90)</span>

<span class="c1">Constitution of India - Article 226 -Intra Court Jurisdiction - Letters patent appeal - </span><span class="c36">A letters patent appeal, as permitted under the Letters Patent, is normally an intra-court appeal whereunder the Letters Patent Bench, sitting as a “Court of Correction”, corrects its own orders in exercise of the same jurisdiction as was vested in the Single Bench: Exercise of intra-court appellate jurisdiction could be called for if the judgment/order under challenge is palpably erroneous or suffers from perversity; but, it may not be exercised when two views are possible on a given set of facts and one of two views has been taken which is a plausible view.  (Para 50-51) “</span><span class="c1">Person aggrieved”:</span><span class="c7"> A writ appeal is a continuation of the original writ petition - anyone who may file a writ petition would have the locus standi to file a writ appeal albeit with some caveats: A person aggrieved having locus standi to prefer an appeal would be one who is directly affected or impacted by a judgment, order or decision even though the same does not directly require him to do something, or, one, who being a party to a suit, is adversely affected by the decree. To file an appeal, such a person typically needs to show affectation of a legal right or interest, or that he is likely to suffer a legal wrong as a result of its impact. A mere interest or concern in the subject matter decided by the original court would not be enough - the conditions that need to be satisfied before a person is entitled to maintain an appeal. These are: 1) that the appealing party has been a party in the proceedings from which the appeal has arisen; 2) that the definitive and conclusive ruling of the High Court on the rights of the parties in dispute is the subject of the appeal; and 3) that he is a ‘person aggrieved’, that is, a party who has been adversely affected by the determination.  Condition (1) supra may, however, stand relaxed in given cases (Para 50- 67)</span>

<span class="c1">Appeal</span><span class="c7"> -An appeal is always a creature of statute - The right of appeal is the right of reaching out to a superior court, invoking its authority to have a relook at the facts vis-àvis the law applicable and to rectify the errors committed by a court inferior in the hierarchy. It is a very valuable right. Therefore, when the statute confers such a right of appeal, it is open to the person aggrieved to seek correction of the errors committed by the inferior court. (Para 45-46)</span>

<span class="c1">Public Service Commission</span><span class="c7"> - Although the recommendations made by a Public Service Commission are not binding and hence, may or may not be accepted by the Government of the State, one thing is clear: the latter has no authority to appoint anyone not recommended by the former. (Para 73)</span>

<span class="c1">Executive instructions</span><span class="c7">  - executive instructions may supplement, but not supplant, statutory rules and should be subservient to statutory provisions.</span>

<span class="c1">Constitution of India - Article 14,226 </span><span class="c7">- Perpetuation of illegality ought to be shunned by any Court of law. This forms the basis for denying the plea of negative equality -The illegality in recommending some of the candidates figuring in the reserve list could not have been made the basis for issuance of a writ of mandamus citing Article 14 of the Constitution.  (Para 101-102)</span>

<span class="c1">Constitution of India - Article 226 - Service Disputes </span><span class="c7">- A substantial number of service-related disputes pending across the country are aggravated by protracted and recurring litigation, resulting in a state of perpetual flux for many candidates across the country. The judiciary would do well to remain circumspect of these practical realities, and interpret service rules in a manner that furthers the very object of a selection process, that is, the selection of the most suitable candidates from suitable candidates for appointment in a timely manner. (Para 123)</span>

<span class="c1">Summary</span><span class="c7">: Appeal by the Rajasthan Public Service Commission against High Court orders that had directed the appointment of candidates from a reserve list after several originally selected individuals failed to join their posts - Allowing appeal, SC held  that the Commission had the locus standi to appeal as a constitutional body ; wait-listed candidates possess no indefeasible right to appointment, particularly once the statutory validity period of the list has lapsed; the six-month validity of a reserve list under the relevant rules must be strictly calculated from the date the original list was forwarded rather than from the date a vacancy later arose due to non-joining.</span>

Exercising Article 142, the Court issued directions including mandatory police reporting of any student suicide or unnatural death, annual reporting to regulators, filling faculty and leadership vacancies within four months, clearing scholarship backlogs promptly, ensuring round-the-clock medical access, and strict compliance with UGC regulations on equity, anti‑ragging, sexual harassment, and grievance redressal. The Court also asked the Task Force to develop model SOPs for wellbeing audits, faculty training, and campus mental health services, aiming for a unified, enforceable student well‑being framework.</span>

Thus, an agreement to sell or a contract for sale with or without possession is not a conveyance deed. Therefore, a sale of immovable property can only be made by a registered instrument and that an agreement of sale does not create any interest or charge on its subject matter. (Para 5.10)</span>

Continuous possession of a tenant in the suit property even after entering into the sale agreements would not by itself amount to a part-performance, putting the tenant in possession of the suit properties pursuant to the sale agreements.

### <span class="c5">Matrimonial Matters -</span><span class="c9"> Warring couples cannot be allowed to settle their scores by treating Courts as their battlefield and choke the system. If there is no compatibility, there are modes available for early resolution of disputes. Process of mediation is the mode which can be explored at the stage of pre-litigation and even after litigation starts. When the parties start litigating against each other, especially on criminal side, the chances of reunion are remote but should not be ruled out. (Para 21) First and the foremost, earnest effort should be made by the parties and to be guided by the advocates, whensoever consulted in the process, is to convince them for a pre-litigation mediation. Rather in some cases, their counselling may be required - Even if a case is filed in a Court on a trivial issue such as maintenance under Section 144 of BNSS, 2023 (earlier Section 125 of CrPC, 1973) or Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the first effort required to be made by the Court is to explore mediation instead of calling upon the parties for filing replies as allegations and counter allegations sometimes aggravate the dispute. Even when a complaint is sought to be registered with the police of simple matrimonial dispute, first and the foremost effort has to be for re-conciliation, that too, if possible, through the mediation centers in the Courts, instead of calling the parties to the police stations. This sometimes becomes a point of no return specially when any of the parties is arrested, may it be even for a day. (Para 24) It is the duty of all concerned including the family members of the parties to make their earnest effort to resolve the disputes before any civil or criminal proceedings are launched.(Para 25)</span>

State of Rajasthan; 2026 INSC 71 - S.17 Prevention Of Corruption Act - Investigation By State Agencies</a></span>

### <span class="c5">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: Sections 17 -</span><span class="c9"> Section 17 does not exclude or prevents the State Police or a Special Agency of the State from registering a crime or investigating cases relating to bribery, corruption and misconduct against Central Government employes- The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) is also a wing of State Police- The offences under the PC Act are also cognizable and can, therefore, be investigated by the State Police or VACB - The only rider is that the investigation can be done only by a police officer of the rank specified in Section 17 of the PC Act. (Para 8)</span>

### <span class="c5">Criminal Investigation -</span><span class="c9"> The relation between the CBI and the State Police is supplementary to each other and as per the CBI constitution and inter se arrangement between CBI and State police there are several areas where the CBI and the Police require inter se cooperation and support.

Improvement Trust - Public Auction - Disclosure Of Litigation</a></span>

### <span class="c5">Public Auction -</span><span class="c9"> Authorities (such as banks, recovery officers, or state bodies) conducting public auctions are legally required to disclose all known encumbrances and litigation relating to the property, as failure to do so invalidates the sale. Suppressing such material facts renders the auction fraudulent or vitiated by material irregularity -Public auction is one of the modes of sale intending to get highest competitive price for the property. Public auction also ensures fairness in actions of the public authorities and their officers who should act fairly and objectively. Their actions should be legitimate. Their dealing should be free from suspicion. Nothing should be suggestive of bias, favouritism, nepotism or beset with suspicious features of underbidding detrimental to the legitimate interest of the stakeholders.</span>

Tukaram (D) 2026 INSC 82 - Registered Sale Deed - Declaration As Sham Document - Presumption About Validity &amp; Genuineness</a></span>

<span class="c13">Specific Relief Act 1963 - Section 34 - Declaration Suit - Registered Sale Deed -</span><span class="c9">Strong presumption about the validity and genuineness- A Court must not lightly or casually declare a registered instrument as a “sham” - The burden of proof to displace this presumption rests heavily upon the challenger. Such a challenge can only be sustained if the party provides material particulars and cogent evidence to demonstrate that the Deed was never intended to operate as a bona fide transfer of title - The grounds typically accepted to challenge a registered Deed at the instance of the vendee/executant are fraud or want of capacity in any party or mistake of fact or fundamental illegality like where the Deed was executed under deceit or sold by a fraudster who did not own the land or where the Deed was executed without consideration, namely, if no money or value was actually exchanged despite recitals in the Deeds or where there was coercion or intimidation like where the seller was forced to sign without free consent. (Para 31-32) </span>

<span class="c13">Pleading Standards - Code of Civil Procedure - Order VI Rule 4 -</span><span class="c9"> The person alleging that a registered Deed is a sham must satisfy a rigorous standard of pleading by making clear, cogent, convincing averments and provide material particulars in his pleadings and evidence. This Court is of the view that the test akin to a test under Order VI Rule 4 CPC is applicable to such a pleading and clever drafting creating illusion of cause of action would not be permitted and a clear right to sue would have to be shown in the plaint. (Para 34)</span>

<span class="c13">Registration</span><span class="c9"> - Registered documents must inspire certainty; they cannot be rendered precarious by frivolous litigation- caution against the growing tendency to challenge registered instruments ‘at the drop of a hat'. (Para 33)</span>

<span class="c13">Indian Evidence Act, 1872 - Section 91,92 -</span><span class="c9">Mere suspicion or nebulous averments without material particulars would not be sufficient to dislodge the presumption under Sections 91 and 92. (Para 35)</span>

<span class="c13">Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - Section 58- </span><span class="c9">The condition precedent for arriving at a finding that the transaction involves mortgage by way of conditional sale is that there must be an ostensible sale and the condition that on default of payment of mortgage money on a certain date, the sale shall become absolute or on condition that on such payment being made the sale shall become void, or on condition that on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller shall be embodied in the same document-A deeming fiction was added in the negative that a transaction shall not be deemed to be a mortgage unless the condition for reconveyance is contained in the document which purports to effect the sale. (Para 48-49)</span>

<span class="c13">Indian Contract Act, 1872 - Section 25 -</span><span class="c9"> Mere allegation of inadequacy of consideration does not make the Deed void. It is only in the absence of sale consideration being tendered that the sale deed would be void. (Para 60)</span>

<span class="c13">Revenue Entries - </span><span class="c9">Revenue entries in the municipal records do not prove ownership. (Para 63)</span>

<span class="c13">Registration - Reforms -</span><span class="c9"> Urgent need for the digitization of registered documents and land records using secure, tamper-proof technologies such as Blockchain. Many experts believe that Blockchain, a shared, digital record book (ledger) system would ensure that once a transaction of a sale or mortgage or like nature is recorded, it becomes immutable and cryptographically secured- Such reforms are essential to minimize the scourge of forgery and "clever drafting" that clogs our judicial system. Registered documents must inspire absolute confidence to ensure the ease of doing business and to uphold the sanctity of property titles in a modern economy. (Para 76-77)</span>

<span class="c13">Specific Relief Act 1963 - Section 20 (prior to 2018 amendment)-</span><span class="c32"> The discretion to be exercised in a case for specific performance of a contract must be sound and reasonable and not arbitrary. Even if it is lawful to grant the relief, it may not be granted by the court of law in exercise of its discretion judiciously. \[</span><span class="c13">Context</span><span class="c9">: The Trial Court, the First Appellate Court and the High Court had all decreed/affirmed specific performance, but the Supreme Court, applying the discretionary principles in Section 20, held that in the circumstances it was not appropriate to compel execution of the sale deed. Instead, the Court granted the alternative relief of refund.\]</span>

<span class="c5 c11"></span>

<span class="c13">Indian Penal Code 1860 - Section 409 -</span><span class="c32"> The allegations of diversion of funds by the Company - In an offence punishable under Section 409 IPC there is no presumption regarding culpability of a Director. The same would have to be established in a trial. (Para 13) \[</span><span class="c13">Context</span><span class="c9">: The appeal arose from a Delhi High Court order refusing to extend interim bail to Rakesh Jain, a director of M/s Pragat Akshay Urja Limited, accused in an FIR alleging diversion of subsidy funds under sections 409/120B IPC - The Court found it improper that the High Court had repeatedly deferred deciding the regular bail application for want of further deposit. The Court directed the High Court to decide the regular bail application expeditiously.\]</span>

<span class="c9"></span>

<span class="c13">Constitution of India - Article 226 - High Court Direction for filing of charge-sheets by the investigating agency - </span><span class="c32">If the High Court directs, at a stage prior to conclusion of investigation, that a charge-sheet has invariably to be filed upon closure of investigation in a particular case irrespective of what the materials are which have been collected during investigation and without allowing the investigating officer to form his own opinion as regards the next course of action, that would take away the discretion of such officer and he would be left with no other option but to proceed in the direction as required by the high court under pain of threat of contempt. Other than very extreme cases, the high courts ought to exercise restraint and not issue such directions which foreclose the discretion of the executive. \[</span><span class="c13">Context</span><span class="c9">: The appellant had filed a writ petition before the Madras High Court seeking action on his complaints alleging abuse of power and false cases by the police, but the High Court, while dismissing the writ, went on to direct the police to file charge‑sheets in pending cases within four months and the trial courts to complete trials within six months - In Appeal, set aside this direction issued by the High Court.\]</span>

<span class="c13">Constitution of India - Article 226 ; Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 482 ; Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 - Section 528- </span><span class="c9">If any investigation is in progress, the accused generally cannot complain about its mode and manner before the writ court unless the First Information Report does not even prima facie disclose an offence or there are other vitiating factors and even then, only in rare cases can a writ court intervene to halt the investigation- It is the duty of the investigating officer to conduct free, fair and proper investigation and, thereafter, file an appropriate report in terms of Section 173, Cr. PC/Section 193, BNSS. If at all any procedure is given a go-bye in the process, the Cr. PC or the BNSS provides the remedy to the accused which, alone, ordinarily ought to be pursued.  (Para 19)</span>
