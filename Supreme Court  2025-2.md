**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 482 ; Negotiable Instruments Act – Section 138,142 –**When the company is the payee of the cheque based on which a complaint is filed under Section 138 of the NI Act, the complainant should necessarily be the company which is to be represented by an authorised employee and in such a situation, the indication in the complaint and the sworn statement, oral or by affidavit, to the effect that complainant is represented by an authorised person who has knowledge, would be sufficient- if there is any dispute with regard to the person prosecuting the complaint not being authorised or it is to be demonstrated that the complainant had no knowledge of the transaction, and as such could not have instituted and prosecuted the complaint, it would be open for the accused person to dispute the position and establish the same during the course of the trial. However, dismissal or quashing of the complaint at the threshold would not be justified-The issue of proper authorisation and knowledge can only be an issue for trial- (Para 21\) – What can be treated as an explicit averment, cannot be put in a straightjacket but will have to be gathered from the circumstance and manner in which it has been averred and conveyed, based on the facts of each case. (Para 33\)

**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 482 –** The inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly and with great caution and further that inherent powers should not be used to interfere with the jurisdiction of the lower courts or to scuttle a fair investigation or prosecution. (Para 34\)

**Summary**: High Court quashed the summoning order observing that the power of attorney holder did not have personal knowledge of the facts giving rise to the criminal proceedings as there was no specific pleading to that effect in the letter of authority and the affidavit of the power of attorney holder under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C.- Allowing appeal, SC observed: The averments made make it wholly clear that Sh. Neeraj Kumar possessed personal knowledge of the facts of the matter at hand and was well-equipped and duly authorised to initiate criminal proceedings-That beside the fact that it would always be open for the trial court to call upon the complainant for examination and cross- examination, if and when necessary, during the course of the trial. As such, a peremptory quashing of the complaint case by the High Court is completely unwarranted and that too on an incorrect factual basis.

**Electricity Act, 2003- Section 63-** Section 63 does not restrict invoking of the provisions of Section 63 only to Discoms or generating companies- When the provisions of Section 63 of the Act are read in harmony with the provisions of Section 86(1)(b) of the Act, the powers of the State Commission cannot be curtailed by interpreting that the same can be invoked only by the Discoms or the generating companies. (Para 44\)

**Interpretation Of Statutes –**The first and foremost principle of interpretation is that of literal interpretation. When the statute read in a literal manner is capable of giving meaning to the provision that the legislation intended to and does not lead to any absurdity, it is not permissible by judicial interpretation to add, alter, or delete any words to such a statute. (Para 30\)

**Summary**: APTEL held that MCD was neither a distribution licensee nor a generating company and thus it had no jurisdiction to file an application under Section 63 of the Act for adoption of tariff- Allowing appeal, SC observed: when the provisions of Section 63 of the Act are read in harmony with the provisions of Section 86(1)(b) of the Act, the powers of the State Commission cannot be curtailed by interpreting that the same can be invoked only by the Discoms or the generating companies.

**Constitution of India – Article 300A** – Though Right to Property is no more a fundamental right, in view of the provisions of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India, it is a constitutional right.

**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 195** – Complaint which is required to be filed under Section 195 (1) of the CrPC, can only be before a Judicial Magistrate and not an Executive Magistrate who does not have the power to take cognizance of an offence or try such cases. (Para 19\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 – Section 186 ; Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 195** – When no complaint was filed by the concerned public servant as contemplated under Section 195 (1)(a) CrPC, CJM could not have taken cognizance of the offence under Section 186- A written complaint by a public servant before the court takes cognizance is sine qua non, absence of which would vitiate such cognizance being taken for any offence punishable under Section 186\. (Para 15-21) \[In this case, complaint was filed before the City Magistrate and not before a Judicial Magistrate- SC held: the requirement of Section 195 (1) of the CrPC was not fulfilled.\]

**Indian Penal Code 1860 – Section 353-** Not only obstruction but actual use of criminal force or assault on the public servant is necessary- While “disturbance” could also be caused by use of criminal force or assault, unless there are specific allegations with specific acts to that effect, mere allegation of “creating disturbance” cannot mean use of “criminal force” or “assault” within the scope of Section 353 of the IPC. (Para 33\)

**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 154-** Though FIR is not supposed to be an encyclopedia containing all the detailed facts of the incident and it is merely a document that triggers and sets into motion the criminal legal process, yet it must disclose the nature of the offence alleged to have been committed as otherwise, it would be susceptible to being quashed. (Para 25\) If vital and crucial facts are missing from the FIR of which the complainant was fully aware of and was already cognizant of, which he could have mentioned at the first instance, it would indicate that any subsequent mentioning of these facts in the case by the complainant would be an afterthought as has happened in the present case. (Para 27\)

**Constitution of India – Article 141 –** In limine dismissal of a Special Leave Petition at the threshold without giving any detailed reasons does not constitute any declaration of law or a binding precedent under Article 141 of the Constitution. (Para 40\)

**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 155(4)-** If in the course of the investigation of a cognizable offence, the ingredients of a non-cognizable offence are discovered then the police could have continued the investigation without the written complaint to the court or the order of the court in respect of such non-cognizable offence, as it would also be deemed to be a cognizable offence under Section 155(4) of the CrPC, but where the investigation of the cognizable office itself suffers from legal infirmity and without jurisdiction from the initial stage, the entire investigation would be vitiated.

**Constitution of India – Article 226 ; Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 482** \-Normally, quashing of criminal proceedings would be sought and would be done in exercise of the inherent power of the High Court under Section 482, Cr. P.C. But certainly, that does not mean that it could not be done only in invocation of the extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.**Summary** – HC refused to quash FIR against a foreign national- Allowing appeal,SC observed: A perusal of the subject FIR would reveal that the same did not disclose commission of offence(s) as alleged without anything being added to the recitals thereof. That apart, besides the vague allegations, the rest of them, even if taken as true, would not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against, the appellant. In such circumstances, asking the appellant to stand the trial will be nothing but an abuse of process of law and as such, non-interference by refusing to exercise the power to quash the FIR and further proceedings based thereon, would result in miscarriage of justice.

**Summary**: MCOCA accused granted bail by HC- Allowing appeal, SC observed: It is a fact that the grant of bail was not in exercise of power of the High Court as a constitutional Court on the ground of violation of Part-III of the Constitution. It is also a fact that the case on hand involves allegation of commission of offences of murder punishable under Section 302, IPC.

**Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956- Section 16 –** wherever any document registered under the law is produced before the court purporting to record an adoption made and is signed by the persons mentioned therein, the court should presume that the adoption has been made in compliance with the provisions of the said statute unless and until it is disproved. It was further held therein in view of Section 16 of the Act of 1956 that it would be open to the persons who challenge the registered deed of adoption to disprove the same by taking independent proceedings. (Para 16\)

**Relation Back Principle-** Adoption by a widow would relate back to the date of death of her husband, creating an immediate coparcenary interest in the joint property, meaning that the adopted child is treated as if they were born to the deceased husband, thus entitled to inherit his property.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 – Section 420** – To establish the offence of cheating in inducing the delivery of property, the following ingredients need to be proved: (i) The representation made by the person was false. (ii) The accused had prior knowledge that the representation he made was false. (iii) The accused made false representation with dishonest intention in order to deceive the person to whom it was made. (iv) The act where the accused induced the person to deliver the property or to perform or to abstain from any act which the person would have not done or had otherwise committed.- Referred to in Vijay Kumar Ghai v.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 – Section 120B** \-In order to constitute a conspiracy, meeting of minds of two or more persons to do an illegal act or an act by illegal means is a must. In other words, it is sine qua non for invoking the plea of conspiracy against the accused.

**Indian Succession Act, 1925 \-Section 63 (c) –** The language of Section 63(c)of the Act uses the word ‘OR’. It states that each Will shall be attested by two or more witnesses who have seen the Testator sign or affix his mark on the Will OR has seen some other persons sign the Will in the presence and by the direction of the Testator OR has received a personal acknowledgment from the Testator of his signature or mark etc. What flows therefrom is that the witnesses who have attested the Will ought to have seen the Testator sign or attest his mark OR have seen some other persons sign the Will in the presence of and on the direction of the Testator- There is no reason why the ‘or’ employed therein, should be read as ‘and’ – The part of the Section that employs the term ‘direction’ would come into play only when the attestor to the Will would have to see some other person signing the Will. Such signing would explicitly have to be in the presence and upon the direction of the Testator. (Para 12-14)

**Interpretation of Statutes** – The word “or” is normally disjunctive while the word “and” is normally conjunctive. Further, it is equally well settled as a proposition of law that the ordinary, grammatical meaning displayed by the words of the statute should be given effect to unless the same leads to ambiguity, uncertainty or absurdity. None of these requirements, to read a word is which is normally disjunctive, as conjunctive herein, are present. (Para 13\)

(2) Such threat must be intentional; (i) to cause alarm to that person; or (ii) to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat; or (iii) to cause that person to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat. (Para 13\) A mere statement without intention would not attract the offence – For an offence of criminal intimidation to be prima facie established, the intention should be clearly visible, and the same is to be established by evidence on record.(Para 13.2-13.3)

**Mens Rea** – For mens rea to be established, something better than vague statements must be produced before the court. (Para 12.4)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 482**– While considering an application u/s 482 CrPC, the court cannot conduct a mini-trial but instead is to be satisfied that prima facie the offences as alleged are made out. To put it differently, it is to be seen, without undertaking a minute examination of the record, that there is some substance in the allegations made which could meet the threshold of statutory language.

**Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 – Section 23-** In Sudesh Chhikara v.

**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 319 –** Even in a case where the stage of giving opportunity to the complainant to file a protest petition urging upon the trial court to summon other persons as well who were named in the FIR but not implicated in the charge-sheet has gone, in that case also, the Court is still not powerless by virtue of Section 319 CrPC and even those persons named in the FIR but not implicated in the charge- sheet can be summoned to face the trial provided during the trial some evidence surfaces against the proposed accused.

**Closure Report –** The Court should not keep the closure report pending for consideration for a long time. Such report should be looked into promptly. (Para 20\)

**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 319 –**The principles of law summarised: a. On a careful reading of Section 319 of the CrPC as well as the aforesaid two decisions, it becomes clear that the trial court has undoubted jurisdiction to add any person not being the accused before it to face the trial along with other accused persons, if the Court is satisfied at any stage of the proceedings on the evidence adduced that the persons who have not been arrayed as accused should face the trial. It is further evident that such person even though had initially been named in the F.I.R. as an accused, but not charge sheeted, can also be added to face the trial. b. The trial court can take such a step to add such persons as accused only on the basis of evidence adduced before it and not on the basis of materials available in the charge- sheet or the case diary, because such materials contained in the charge sheet or the case diary do not constitute evidence. c. The power of the court under Section 319 of the CrPC is not controlled or governed by naming or not naming of the person concerned in the FIR. Nor the same is dependent upon submission of the chargesheet by the police against the person concerned. As regards the contention that the phrase ‘any person not being the accused’ occurred in Section 319 excludes from its operation an accused who has been released by the police under Section 169 of the Code and has been shown in column No. 2 of the charge sheet, the contention has merely to be stated to be rejected. The said expression clearly covers any person who is not being tried already by the Court and the very purpose of enacting such a provision like Section 319(1) clearly shows that even persons who have been dropped by the police during investigation but against whom evidence showing their involvement in the offence comes before the Criminal Court are included in the said expression. c. It would not be proper for the trial court to reject the application for addition of new accused by considering records of the Investigating Officer. When the evidence of complainant is found to be worthy of acceptance then the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer hardly matters. If satisfaction of Investigating Officer is to be treated as determinative then the purpose of Section 319 would be frustrated- Referred to Hardeep Singh v. State of Punjab, (2014) 3 SCC 92 and Ramesh Chandra Srivastava v. State of U.P. & Another (2021) 12 SCC 608\.

**Criminal Trial –** On the account of defective investigation the benefit will not inure to the accused persons on that ground alone. It is well within the domain of the courts to consider the rest of the evidence which the prosecution has gathered such as statement of the eyewitnesses, medical report etc \-The accused cannot claim acquittal on the ground of faulty investigation done by the prosecuting agency. (Para 22\)

**Criminal Trial –** Law relating to material contradiction in witness testimony discussed – Rammi vs State of MP, Birbal Nath vs State of Rajasthan. (Para 15\) – Either a partial, untrue version of one of the witnesses or an exaggerated version of a witness may not be a sole reason to discard the entire prosecution case which is otherwise supported by clinching evidence such as truthful version of the witnesses, medical evidence, recovery of the weapons etc. (Para 18\)

**Legal Maxims –** “Noscitur a sociis” – The meaning of a word can be determined by the context of the sentence; it is to be judged by the company it keeps. (Para 16\) 

**Legal Maxims –** ‘Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus’- False in one thing, false in everything- This principle is foreign to our criminal law jurisprudence- the principle ‘falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus’ is not a rule of evidence and if the court inspires confidence from the rest of the testimony of such a witness, it can very well rely on such a part of the testimony and base a conviction upon it. (Para 19\) – Only because there are some contradictions which in the opinion of this Court are not even that material, the entire story of the prosecution cannot be discarded as false. It is the duty of the Court to separate the grain from the chaff. In a given case, it is also open to the Court to differentiate the accused who had been acquitted from those who were convicted where there are a number of accused persons. (Para 26\)

**Crime** – Crime creates a sense of societal fear and it affects adversely the societal conscience. It is inequitable and unjust if such a situation is allowed to perpetuate and continue in the society. In every civilized society, the purpose of criminal administrative system is to protect individual dignity and to restore societal stability and order and to create faith and cohesion in the society. The courts in the discharge of their duties are tasked with balancing of interests of the accused on one hand and the state/society on the other. (Para 10\)

**Motor Accident Compensation** \-Jurisprudence on the assessment of compensation to motor accidents’ victims discussed- Money cannot substitute a life lost but an effort has to be made for grant of just compensation so far as money can compensate- The basis for assessment of all damages for person injury is compensation. Perfect compensation is hardly possible but one has to keep in mind that victim has suffered at the hands of the wrongdoer and court must take care to give him full and fair compensation for that he had suffered. In some cases for personal injury, the claim could be in respect of lifetime’s earnings lost because, though he will live, he cannot earn his living. In others, the claim may be made for partial loss of earnings. Each case has to be considered in the light of its own facts and at the end, one must ask whether the sum awarded is a fair and reasonable sum. \[Referred to Referred to General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, Trivandrum vs Susamma Thomas , Sarla Verma vs Delhi Transport Corporation, National Insurance Company Ltd. vs Pranay Sethi , R.D.

The impleadment of the Civil Authority or Registration Officer in all bail applications filed by foreigners may result in unnecessary delay in deciding the bail applications- While granting bail to a foreigner within the meaning of the Act, the concerned court shall issue direction to the State or prosecuting agency, as the case may be, to immediately communicate the order granting bail to the concerned Registration Officer appointed under Rule 3 of the Rules who, in turn, shall communicate the order to all concerned authorities including the Civil Authorities.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 – Section 415,420** \-If a person sells a property knowing that it does not belong to him, and thereby defrauds the person who purchased the property, the person defrauded, that is, the purchaser, may complain that the vendor committed the fraudulent act of cheating. But a third party who is not the purchaser under the deed may not be able to make such complaint. (Para 11\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 482 –** High Court dismissed a writ petition filed by the appellant for quashing a First Information Report alleging offence under Section 415, 420 IPC – Allowing appeal, SC observed: The dispute between the parties is predominantly a civil dispute- When there was a dispute over the title, the act of setting in motion criminal law two years after the date of filing of the suits amounts to nothing but abuse of the process of law.

**NDPS Act-** There is no specific bar/restriction under the provisions of the NDPS Act for return of any seized vehicle used for transporting narcotic drug or psychotropic substance in the interim pending disposal of the criminal case- Court can invoke the general power under Sections 451 and 457 of the Cr.P.C. for return of the seized vehicle pending final decision of the criminal case – Consequently, the trial Court has the discretion to release the vehicle in the interim. However, this power would have to be exercised in accordance with law in the facts and circumstances of each case. (Para 22-23) 

**NDPS Act-** Vehicle is a critical piece of material evidence that may be required for inspection to substantiate the prosecution’s case, yet the said requirement can be met by stipulating conditions while releasing the Vehicle in interim on superdari like videography and still photographs to be authenticated by the Investigating Officer, owner of the Vehicle and accused by signing the said inventory as well as restriction on sale/transfer of the Vehicle. (Para 28\) – Four scenarios in which the drug or substance is seized from a conveyance. Firstly, where the owner of the vehicle is the person from whom the possession of contraband drugs/substance is recovered. Secondly, where the contraband is recovered from the possession of the agent of the owner i.e. like driver or cleaner hired by the owner. Thirdly, where the vehicle has been stolen by the accused and contraband is recovered from such stolen vehicle. Fourthly, where the contraband is seized / recovered from a third-party occupant (with or without consideration) of the vehicle without any allegation by the police that the contraband was stored and transported in the vehicle with the owner’s knowledge and connivance. In the first two scenarios, the owner of the vehicle and/or his agent would necessarily be arrayed as an accused. In the third and fourth scenario, the owner of the vehicle and/or his agent would not be arrayed as an accused- Consequently, it is only in the first two scenarios that the vehicle may not be released on superdari till reverse burden of proof is discharged by the accused-owner. However, in the third and fourth scenarios, where no allegation has been made in the charge-sheet against the owner and/or his agent, the vehicle should normally be released in the interim on superdari subject to the owner furnishing a bond that he would produce the vehicle as and when directed by the Court and/or he would pay the value of the vehicle as determined by the Court on the date of the release, if the Court is finally of the opinion that the vehicle needs to be confiscated. (Para 29-31)

**Interpretation of Statutes** \-The more absurd a suggested conclusion of construction is, the more the court will lean against that conclusion. That is ordinarily so whether one is construing a contract or a statute. (Para 24\)

**Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1958- Rules 27(a) and 27(c)** – Seniority to be reckoned from the order of his first appointment and the inter-se seniority be determined as per the date of first effective advice made for his appointment in service, class, category or grade as the case may be. The proviso of Rule 27(a) is merely an exception to the said Rule of maintaining the seniority from the date of appointment in the cases of ‘on request’ and mutual transfer. The said exception does not attract in a case of transfer by way of absorption made by the Government in public interest or in administrative exigencies. Thus, proviso to Rule 27(a) is an exception to the transfer on administrative grounds in public interest. (Para 37\) – the transfer by way of absorption on exercise of option as specified in Appendix I and Appendix II contained in G.O. dated 25.10.2008 does not attract the proviso to Rule 27(a) of KS\&SS Rules, which only deals with the transfer on request or on mutual request. Thus, the action taken in public interest due to administrative exigency even on option is different than the action done on request. In our view, the proviso to Rule 27(a) does not attract in case of a transfer by way of absorption done by the Department in furtherance to the policy decision of the Government. Therefore, transfer by way of absorption in public interest cannot be equated with the transfer on request in contingencies as specified in proviso to Rule 27(a) or applied mutually. (Para 47\)

**Service Law – Transfer –** The transfer of an employee is an incidence of service if it is in public interest. It cannot be disputed that the Government is the best judge to decide how to distribute and utilise the services of an employee. Simultaneously, if employee makes a request due to some hardship and if the authority or the Government as the case may be is satisfied, it may post such employee as per request, but such transfer cannot be termed as transfer in public interest because it is on the request of the employee and not in the exigencies of the public administration- If transfer is by absorption, then such employee becomes part and parcel of the department absorbing him and partakes the same colour and character of the existing employees. In other words, absorb clearly indicates to suck up, to imbibe to draw as a constituent part and consume. (Para 39-42)

**Service Law- Option & Request** – ‘Option’ gives a right to choose with freedom of choosing amongst the choices presented to the person concerned, whereas a ‘request’ is the desire of a person to be granted something by asking or is a demand or requirement of the employee. (Para 46\)

**Principle Of Vicarious Liability** – There is no vicarious liability unless the statute specifically provides so. Thus, an individual who has perpetrated the commission of an offence on behalf of a company can be made an accused, if the statute provides for such liability and if there is sufficient evidence of his active role coupled with criminal intent. The primary responsibility is on the complainant to make specific averments as are required under the law in the complaint so as to make the accused vicariously liable. For fastening criminal liability on an officer of a company, there is no presumption that every officer of a company knows about the transaction in question. (Para 13\) Mere authorization of an act at the behest of the company or the exercise of a supervisory role over certain actions or activities of the company is not enough to render a director vicariously liable. There must exist something to show that such actions of the director stemmed from their personal involvement and arose from actions or conduct falling outside the scope of its routine corporate duties. (Para 12\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 156(3), 200 –**When jurisdiction is exercised on a complaint petition filed in terms of Section 156(3) or Section 200 of the CrPC, the Court concerned should remain vigilant & apply its mind carefully before taking cognizance of a complaint. (Para 15\)

**Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 –** Section 4,19- The complaint lodged by the Range Forest Officer under Section 4 read with Section 19 of the Act- SC held: There are no allegations worth the name in the complaint that the three appellants before us are directly responsible for uprooting of the trees with the aid of Bulldozers or JCB machines or causing damage to the environment- The impugned complaint and order taking cognizance of the said complaint quashed.

**Circumstantial Evidence –** Principles that courts must adhere to while appreciating and evaluating evidence in cases based on circumstantial evidence, as follows: (i). The testimony of each prosecution and defence witness must be meticulously discussed and analysed. Each witness’s evidence should be assessed in its entirety to ensure no material aspect is overlooked. (ii). Circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact. Thus, the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the testimony of each witness must be explicitly delineated. (iii). Each of the links of incriminating circumstantial evidence should be meticulously examined so as to find out if each one of the circumstances is proved individually and whether collectively taken, they forge an unbroken chain consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with his innocence. (iv). The judgment must comprehensively elucidate the rationale for accepting or rejecting specific pieces of evidence, demonstrating how the conclusion was logically derived from the evidence. It should explicitly articulate how each piece of evidence contributes to the overall narrative of guilt. (v). The judgment must reflect that the finding of guilt, if any, has been reached after a proper and careful evaluation of circumstances in order to determine whether they are compatible with any other reasonable hypothesis. (Para 30\)

**Bombay Improvement Trust Transfer Act, 1925** – **Section 48(a) and 51(2)** – Under general provisions, the lessee has to leave the premise on completion of the period of lease, however, it will have a right to get the conveyance executed at the end of the lease, provided there has been no default, after paying the cost of the said premise- the interplay between Sections 48(a) and 51(2) of the 1925 Act is resolved through a construction that acknowledges the necessity of leaving the premises in good condition at the expiration of lease, while recognizing that a conveyance can be contemplated only where such a course is unequivocally aligned with the lease terms and the statutory framework as a whole. (Para 52\)

**Interpretation of Statutes –** No provision of a statute should be rendered nugatory or superfluous. A statute must be construed as a coherent whole, ensuring that each part has meaningful content and that the legislative scheme remains workable. Where two provisions appear to be in tension, the proper course is to adopt a construction that reconciles them, allowing both to operate and giving effect to the underlying legislative intent.

**Income Tax Act, 1961 – Section 2(47) –**The reduction in share capital of the subsidiary company and subsequent proportionate reduction in the shareholding of the assessee would be squarely covered within the ambit of the expression “sale, exchange or relinquishment of the asset” used in Section 2(47) the Income Tax Act, 1961- Relinquishment of an asset or extinguishment of any right therein amounts to a transfer of a capital asset. While the taxpayer continues to remain a shareholder of the company even with the reduction of share capital, it could not be accepted that there was no extinguishment of any part of his right as a shareholder qua the company – A company under Section 66 of the Companies Act, 2013 has a right to reduce the share capital and one of the modes which could be adopted is to reduce the face value of the preference share- When as a result of the reducing of the face value of the share, the share capital is reduced, the right of the preference shareholder to the dividend or his share capital and the right to share in the distribution of the net assets upon liquidation is extinguished proportionately to the extent of reduction in the capital. Such a reduction of the right of the capital asset clearly amounts to a transfer within the meaning of section 2(47). (Para 12(c))

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 – Order VII Rule 11** – Rejection of Plaint – Caselaws discussed (Para 6.1) \-Normally the question of limitation would be a mixed question of law and fact. Hence, usually, on a reading of the plaint it is not rejected as being barred by the law of limitation. However, the above is not an inflexible rule. (Para 8.8) – while considering the question of rejection of the plaint, it is the plaint alone which has to be read meaningfully and not any averment in the written statement. It is also necessary sometimes to consider the documents annexed to the plaint for a holistic and comprehensive reading of the plaint in order to decide whether the plaint ought to be rejected or not. (Para 8.2)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \-Order VII Rule 13 –** Rejection of earlier suit under Order VII Rule 11 does not bar fresh suit on the same cause of action provided the right of action is not barred by the law of limitation. (Para 7.4)

**Limitation Act 1963 – Article 113 –** If a suit is not covered by any of the specific articles prescribing a period of limitation, it must fall within the residuary article. The purpose of the residuary article is to provide for cases which could not be covered by any other provision in the Limitation Act. The residuary article is applicable to every variety of suits not otherwise provided for under the Limitation Act. It prescribes a period of three years from the date when the “right to sue” accrues- The expression “when the right to sue accrues” in Article 113 of the Limitation Act need not always mean “when the right to sue first accrues”. For the right to sue to accrue, the right sought to be vindicated in the suit should have already come into existence and there should be an infringement of it or at least a serious threat to infringe the same – the right to sue accrues only when the cause of action arises, that is, the right to prosecute to obtain relief by legal means. The suit must be instituted when the right asserted in the suit is infringed or when there is a clear and unequivocal threat to infringe that right by the defendant against whom the suit is instituted. Article 113 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act provides for a suit to be instituted within three years from the date when the right to sue accrues and not on the happening of an event as stated in Article 54 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act. (Para 9\)

**Limitation Act 1963 – Section 9** – Section 9 is based on the general principle that when once limitation has started to run, it will continue to do so unless it is arrested by reason of any express statutory provision. Period of limitation can be extended, inter alia, when cause of action was cancelled such as by dismissal of a suit. Ordinarily, limitation runs from the earliest time at which an action can be brought and after it has commenced to run, there may be revival of a right to sue where a previous satisfaction of a claim is nullified with the result that the right to sue which has been suspended is reanimated.

**Juvenile Justice Act 2015- Section 9(2)** \-The plea of juvenility can be raised before any Court, meaning thereby that there is no question of finality in this regard until and unless an application filed, invoking this provision, is determined in accordance with the 2015 Act and the relevant rules. When such a plea is raised, it shall be recognised and cannot be brushed aside in a casual or whimsical manner. A due determination must be made by judiciously considering the material available on record. The Court is expected to travel an extra mile to satisfy its conscience as to whether the case on hand would attract the provisions of the 2015 Act and, for the aforesaid purpose, the process enumerated thereunder will have to be necessarily followed- .Merely because a casual adjudication has taken place, it does not mean that a plea of juvenility cannot be raised subsequently. This is for the simple reason that the plea of juvenility has not attained. finality. So long as the right of a party subsists, one can never say that finality has been attained. In a case where a plea has been raised, but not adjudicated upon, the decision rendered thereunder would not amount to attaining finality. Likewise, when such a plea is not treated as one under Section 9(2) of the 2015 Act in compliance with the procedural mandate specified thereunder, an order rejecting such a plea would not be termed as a final one. To put it differently, even assuming a plea of juvenility was raised but not considered appropriately at the time of disposal of a Special Leave Petition/Statutory Criminal Appeal, a Review Petition, or a Curative Petition thereafter, it would not bar a competent Court from deciding the said issue by following due procedure.- If an adjudication is based on due determination, then there may not be any room for another round of litigation. But, in a case where the plea was not treated as an application under Section 9(2) of the 2015 Act and, the procedure mandated thereunder was not followed, the principle as aforesaid would certainly apply as the right of raising the plea of juvenility has not ceased and, therefore, subsists. (Para 22\)

**Constitution of India – Article 32, 226, 72 and 161 –** Power under Article 72 and 161 of the Constitution is not appellate or revisional in nature. It is an executive power travelling on a different channel, which cannot be termed as a power of appeal or review. .A challenge to the exercise of power under Article 72 and 161 of the Constitution would involve limited judicial review on grounds such as inadequate application of mind, amongst others. (Para 30-31)

**Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 \-Section 9(2)** – When a challenge is made to an executive order, with an independent prayer for exercising the power under Section 9(2) of the 2015 Act, they being distinct and independent, refusal of judicial review of the former will not obliterate the mandatory duty pertaining to the latter. (Para 32\)

**Truth, Court and Law –** Justice is nothing but a manifestation of the truth. It is truth which transcends every other action. The primary duty of a Court is to make a single-minded endeavour to unearth the truth hidden beneath the facts. Thus, the Court is a search engine of truth, with procedural and substantive laws as its tools- When procedural law stands in the way of the truth, the Court must find a way to circumvent it. Similarly, when substantive law, as it appears, does not facilitate the emergence of the truth, it is the aramount duty of the Court to interpret the law in light of its teleos. Such an exercise is warranted in a higher degree, particularly while considering a social welfare legislation- In its journey, the Court must discern the truth, primarily from the truth, primarily from the material available on record in the form of pleadings, and arguments duly supported by documents. It must be kept in mind that the entire judicial system is meant for the discovery of the truth, it being the soul of a decision. For doing so, a Presiding Officer is expected to play an active role, rather than a passive one. (Para 4-6)

**Juvenile Court-** Court is expected to play the role of parens patriae by treating a child not as a delinquent, but as a victim, viewed through the lens of reformation, rehabilitation and reintegration into the society – Thus, a Juvenile Court is a species of a parent. A delinquent, who appears before the Court, is to be protected and re-educated, rather than be judged and punished. It is for this purpose, that the Court will have to press into service the benevolent provisions for rehabilitation introduced by the Legislature. A Juvenile Court assumes the role of an institution rendering psychological services. It must forget that it is acting as a Court, and must don the robes of a correction home for a deviant child. (Para 10-11)

**Legal Maxims – Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit** – No one shall be prejudiced by an act of the Court. A mistake committed by the Court cannot stand in the way of one’s rightful benefit. It is not the party which commits a mistake, but rather the Court itself. Hence, such a mistake cannot act as a barrier for the party to get its due relief. However, we make it clear that the mistake must be so apparent that it does not brook any adjudication on the foundational facts. (Para 28\)

**Indian Stamp Act 1899 – Section 47A** – Registering Officer, after registration of the document, can refer the same for adjudication before the Collector, if he has reason to believe that there was deliberate undervaluation of the property. Such a reference is not a mechanical act, but the Registering Officer should have a basis for coming to prima facie finding of undervaluation of the property. Duty is enjoined upon the Registering Officer to ensure that Section 47-A(1) does not work as an engine of oppression nor as a matter of routine, mechanically, without application of mind as to the existence of any material or reason to believe the fraudulent intention to evade payment of proper Stamp Duty. The expression ‘reason to believe’ is not synonymous with subjective satisfaction of the officer. The belief must be held in good faith, it cannot be merely a pretence. It is open to the Court to examine the question whether the reasons for the belief must have a rational connection or a relevant bearing to the formation of the belief and are not irrelevant or extraneous to the purpose of the section \-The word ‘reason to believe’ means some material on the basis of which the department can re-open the proceedings.

**Criminal Trial – “Reasonable doubt”-** It means that such doubt must be free from suppositional speculation. It must not be the result of minute emotional detailing, and the doubt must be actual and substantial and not merely vague apprehension. A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or a merely possible doubt, but a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense (Para 21\) \-The concept of reasonable doubt has to be also understood in the Indian context, keeping in mind the social reality and this principle cannot be stretched beyond a reasonable limit to avoid generating a cynical view (Para 23\) \-The requirement of law in criminal trials is not to prove the case beyond all doubt but beyond reasonable doubt and such doubt cannot be imaginary, fanciful, trivial or merely a possible doubt but a fair doubt based on reason and common sense. (Para 26\)

**Criminal Trial –** Non recovery of the weapon of crime is not fatal to the prosecution case and is not sine qua non for conviction, if there are direct reliable witnesses. (Para 70\) the testimony of the police personnel involved in recovery of articles need not be disbelieved and testimony of police personnel is to be treated similarly as testimony of any other witness. (Para 71\) Merely because the witnesses turn hostile does not necessarily mean that their evidence has to be thrown out entirely and what is supportive of the prosecution certainly be used. (Para 76\)

There is not a whisper in the impugned order about any failure of justice having occurred on account of the impugned Sanction Order.

(Para 27-29)

**Railways Act, 1989 – Section 143 –** Section 143 does not criminalise creating multiple user IDs. It penalises the actions of only the unauthorised agents and not unauthorised actions of the authorised agents – Any breach has to be remedied by civil action and not criminal action.

**Interpretation of Statutes –** No court can refuse to enforce a provision on the sole basis of the provision predating any subsequent development- If it can be demonstrated that a statutory provision is broad enough to envelop the subsequent developments, even if the developments were not envisioned by the legislature, the provision would stay operational. (Para 21\) – If the language of the particular statute under consideration is clear and unambiguous, it is not for the courts to add to or delete any words from the statute in the guise of ascertaining what could have been the legislative intent.

(Para 21\)

**Specific Relief Act 1963 \- Section 12 (3)-** The words **‘unable to perform’** suggest that the sub-section is applicable only when the party cannot for any reason perform the whole of what he has promised. The inability may arise by any cause whatsoever including any statutory limitations. The inability to perform may arise by— (i) deficiency in quantity of the subject-matter, or (ii) variance in quality, or (iii) defect in title; or (iv) some legal prohibition; or (v) other causes- The expression **‘considerable part’** implies that the part which will be left unperformed is either large as regards quantity or as regards quality. In other words, it is material and not insignificant, so that a reasonable objection can be taken by the promisee to accept performance. The phrase **‘does not admit of compensation’** implies that there is no data for ascertaining a fair and reasonable amount as the money value of the difference between what can be performed and the express subject-matter of the contract. The amount need not be mathematically accurate. If a reasonable estimate of the amount as the money value can be made, it will not be a case where the compensation is unascertainable. (Para 10-13)

**Limitation Act 1963- Section 5 –**While considering the plea for condonation of delay, the court must not start with the merits of the main matter. The court owes a duty to first ascertain the bona fides of the explanation offered by the party seeking condonation. It is only if the sufficient cause assigned by the litigant and the opposition of the other side is equally balanced that the court may bring into aid the merits of the matter for the purpose of condoning the delay – The question of limitation is not merely a technical consideration. The rules of limitation are based on the principles of sound public policy and principles of equity. No court should keep the ‘Sword of Damocles’ hanging over the head of a litigant for an indefinite period of time- Concepts such as “liberal approach”, “Justice oriented approach”, “substantial justice” should not be employed to frustrate or jettison the substantial law of limitation- The length of the delay is definitely a relevant matter which the court must take into consideration while considering whether the delay should be condoned or not- The rules of limitation are not meant to destroy the rights of parties. They are meant to see that the parties do not resort to dilatory tactics but seek their remedy promptly. (Para 13-17)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 125(4) –** Mere passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights at the husband’s behest and non-compliance therewith by the wife would not, by itself, be sufficient to attract the disqualification under Section 125(4) Cr.P.C. It would depend on the facts of the individual case and it would have to be decided, on the strength of the material and evidence available, whether the wife still had valid and sufficient reason to refuse to live with her husband, despite such a decree. There can be no hard and fast rule in this regard and it must invariably depend on the istinctive facts and circumstances obtaining in each particular case. In any event, a decree for restitution of conjugal rights secured by a husband coupled with non-compliance therewith by the wife would not be determinative straightaway either of her right to maintenance or the applicability of the disqualification under Section 125(4) Cr.P.C.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 125-** Even if non-compliance with an order for payment of maintenance entails penal consequences, as may other decrees of a Civil Court, such proceedings would not qualify as or become criminal proceedings. Nomenclature of maintenance proceedings initiated under the Code of Criminal Procedure, as those provisions find place therein, cannot be held to be conclusive as to the nature of such proceedings. (Para 30\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 125-** A wife, who suffered a decree of divorce on the ground of deserting her husband, would not be entitled to maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. as long as the marriage subsisted, but she would be entitled to such maintenance once she attained the status of a divorced wife, in the light of the definition of a ‘wife’ in Explanation (b) to Section 125(1) Cr.P.C.

**Code Of Civil Procedure 1908- Order II Rule 2 \-** i**.**The object of Order II Rule 2 is to prevent the multiplicity of suits and the provision is founded on the principle that a person shall not be vexed twice for one and the same cause. ii. The mandate of Order II Rule 2 is the inclusion of the whole claim arising in respect of one and the same cause of action, in one suit. It must not be misunderstood to mean that all the different causes of action arising from the same transaction must be included in a single suit. iii. Several definitions have been given to the phrase “cause of action” and it can safely be said to mean – “every fact which would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the Court”. Such a cause of action has no relation whatsoever to the defence that may be set up by the defendant, nor does it depend upon the character of the relief which is prayed for by the plaintiff but refers to the media upon which the plaintiff asks the Court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour. iv. Similarly, several tests have been laid out to determine the applicability of Order II Rule 2 to a suit. While it is acknowledged that the same heavily depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case, it can be said that a correct and reliable test is to determine whether the claim in the new suit is in fact founded upon a cause of action distinct from that which was the foundation of the former suit. Additionally, if the evidence required to support the claims is different, then the causes of action can also be considered to be different. Furthermore, it is necessary for the causes of action in the two suits to be identical in substance and not merely technically identical.v. The defendant who takes shelter under the bar imposed by Order II Rule 2(3) must establish that (a) the second suit was in respect of the same cause of action as that on which the previous suit was based; (b) in respect of that cause of action, the plaintiff was entitled to more than one relief; and (c) being thus entitled to more than one relief, the plaintiff, without any leave obtained from the Court, omitted to sue for the relief for which the second suit had been filed. vi. The defendant must also have produced the earlier plaint in evidence in order to establish that there is an identity in the causes of action between both the suits and that there was a deliberate relinquishment of a larger relief on the part of the plaintiff. vii. Since the plea is a technical bar, it has to be established satisfactorily and cannot be presumed merely on the basis of inferential reasoning. (Para 47\) \- The stage at which the first suit is, would not be a material consideration in deciding the applicability of the bar under Order II Rule 2\. What needs to be looked into is whether the cause of action in both suits is one and the same in substance, and whether the plaintiff is agitating the second suit for claiming a relief which was very well available to him at the time of filing the first suit. (Para 51\)

**Code Of Civil Procedure 1908- Order VII Rule 11(d) and Order II Rule 2 \-** Before rejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11(d), the Courts must ensure that the plaint is read as a whole and its entire averments are looked into. A few lines or passages must not be read in isolation and it is imperative that the pleadings are read as a whole for ascertaining the true import of the averments therein. In performing such a holistic reading, it must be deduced whether the causes of action in both the suits are identical in substance in order to sustain a successful plea under Order II Rule 2\. It would be a reductive approach to only cull out the cause of action paragraphs from the respective plaints and decide that they disclose the same cause of action on mere comparative overview.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 306 \- BNS 2023 \- Section 108 \-**Section 306 IPC appears to be casually and too readily resorted to by the police. While the persons involved in genuine cases where the threshold is met should not be spared, the provision should not be deployed against individuals, only to assuage the immediate feelings of the distraught family of the deceased. The conduct of the proposed accused and the deceased, their interactions and conversations preceding the unfortunate death of the deceased should be approached from a practical point of view and not divorced from day-to-day realities of life. Hyperboles employed in exchanges should not, without anything more, be glorified as an instigation to commit suicide. It is time the investigating agencies are sensitised to the law laid down by this Court under Section 306 so that persons are not subjected to the abuse of process of a totally untenable prosecution- The trial courts also should exercise great caution and circumspection and should not adopt a play it safe syndrome by mechanically framing charges, even if the investigating agencies in a given case have shown utter disregard for the ingredients of Section 306.(Para 20\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 306 \- BNS 2023 \- Section 108** \- To attract the ingredient of Section 306, the accused should have abetted the commission of a suicide. A person abets the doing of a thing who Firstly \- instigates any person to do that thing or Secondly \- engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing or Thirdly \- intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing- In order to bring a case within the purview of Section 306 IPC there must be a case of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the person who is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of abetment by the person charged with the said offence must be proved and established by the prosecution before he could be convicted under Section 306 IPC. To satisfy the requirement of instigation the accused by his act or omission or by a continued course of conduct should have created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide- A word uttered in a fit of anger and emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow cannot be said to be instigation.

Any inventory, photographs or samples of seized substance prepared in substantial compliance of the procedure prescribed under Section 52A of the NDPS Act and the Rules / Standing Order(s) thereunder would have to be mandatorily treated as primary evidence as per Section 52A sub- section (4) of the NDPS Act, irrespective of whether the substance in original is actually produced before the court or not. (Para 50\)

**NDPS Act \- Section 52A, 54**\- Where there has been lapse on the part of the police in either following the procedure laid down in Section 52A of the NDPS Act or the prosecution in proving the same, it will not be appropriate for the court to resort to the statutory presumption of commission of an offence from the possession of illicit material under Section 54 of the NDPS Act, unless the court is otherwise satisfied as regards the seizure or recovery of such material from the accused persons from the other material on record (Para 50\)

**NDPS Act \- Section 52A \-** Burden of proof \- The initial burden will lie on the accused to first lay the foundational facts to show that there was non-compliance of Section 52A, either by leading evidence of its own or by relying upon the evidence of the prosecution, and the standard required would only be preponderance of probabilities- Once the foundational facts laid indicate non-compliance of Section 52A of the NDPS Act, the onus would thereafter be on the prosecution to prove by cogent evidence that either (i) there was substantial compliance with the mandate of Section 52A of the NDPS Act OR (ii) satisfy the court that such non-compliance does not affect its case against the accused, and the standard of proof required would be beyond a reasonable doubt. (Para 50\)

**NDPS Act \- Section 52A \-**Mere drawing of samples in presence of a gazetted officer would not constitute sufficient compliance of the mandate under Section 52A sub-section (2) of the NDPS Act- the process of inventorying, photographing and drawing samples of the seized substance shall as far as possible, take place in the presence of the accused, though the same may not be done at the very spot of seizure. (Para 50\)

**NDPS Act \- Section 52A** \- Section(s) 42 to 57 form a unique scheme of provisions that prescribe several procedural safeguards and conditions that have to be mandatorily adhered to, right from the process of conducting search till the seizure and recovery of the contraband, its safe-keep and handling, yet it does not mean that a mere delay or non-compliance of the same, would result in the trial being vitiated, or the entire case of prosecution crumbling.(Para 23\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 21 \-** The prison administration needs to be reformed for creating a better environment and prison culture to ensure the prisoners enjoy their right to dignified life under Article 21\. It is essential to continuously monitor the physical conditions prevailing in the prison, compliance with basic and fundamental rights of the prisoners, etc. The State recognizes that a prisoner loses his right to liberty but still maintains his right to be treated as a human being and as person. His human dignity shall be maintained and all basic amenities should be made available to him. Discipline and order shall be maintained with firmness, but with no more restriction than is necessary for safe custody and well-ordered community life, with due regard to the maintenance of the rights of prisoners. Thus, the objective of reforms and rehabilitation of the prisoners has to be pursued diligently- The State of Jharkhand shall, if not already done, formulate or expedite the formulation of a Jail Manual incorporating the applicable provisions of the 2016 Model Prison Manual, for effective prison administration and ensure its strict compliance by the prison authorities. (Para 17-18)

**Prisoners Act, 1900 \-** Inspector General of Prisons, has discretion to transfer a prisoner from one prison to another or from one class to another. The only caution, we may add, is that such discretion cannot be exercised arbitrarily-  transfer of prisoners from one jail to another is not a matter of routine and must be approached with circumspection-The transfer of convict prisoner from one prison to another is purely an administrative decision and hence, the same cannot be interfered with by the court unless it is arbitrary and contrary to law. (Para 11-16)

**Prisons** \- Prisons are considered as the ‘tailend’ of the criminal justice system. They have existed since ancient times, where anti-social elements were kept in, for deterrence and retribution. But, in modern days, a prison connotes a correctional mechanism, thereby emphasizing the reform of inmates. Prison life necessitates certain constraints on the freedom of inmates. Therefore, it is imperative on the part of the prison authorities to rehabilitate the prisoners into law abiding citizen, besides maintaining security and rule of law in the prison. (Para 3\)

**Prison Manual 2016 and Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023** \-  if the situation necessitates transfer of the prisoner from one jail to another, it can be done by the authority concerned. (Para 14\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 100** \- Second Appeal \-High Court acquires jurisdiction to deal with the second appeal on merits only when it frames a substantial question of law as required to be framed under Section 100 CPC; and it cannot grant an interim order, without framing substantial question of law. (Para 10.2)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 151 \-** The High Court cannot use its inherent power under Section 151 in violation of the express mandates in other provisions of the Code. (Para 10.3)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 100** \- High Court can proceed to hear a Second Appeal only if the case involves a substantial question of law, implying that when the appeal is taken up for admission, it must satisfy itself that a substantial question of law is involved. Thereafter, the High Court must frame such question and direct the parties to submit their arguments on such question. The scheme of the Code also enables the High Court to hear the parties on any other substantial question of law, not framed by it at the first hearing, but during the course of hearing for the reasons to be recorded. Again, if the court is not satisfied at the first hearing that the case does not involve a substantial question of law, it cannot proceed further. Once such additional question of law is framed during the course of hearing, the parties must be given opportunity to submit their arguments on the other substantial question of law(s) \-In some High Courts, there is a practice to order Notice of Motion, whereby even before an appeal is admitted, an opportunity is granted to the respondents therein to contest the case. In such a case, it is implied that the High Court is not satisfied prima facie with the case. Such dissatisfaction could be either for a reason that the case does not involve a substantial question of law or for a reason that in the facts of the case, the question of law, though substantial, would not warrant interference. In such cases, though the High Court in exercise of its power under Section 151 of CPC is generally empowered to grant interim orders to preserve the subject matter of the dispute and to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, we are of the opinion, the court cannot grant any interim protection to the appellant, unless the substantial question of law is framed under Section 100 (4) or as per the Proviso. On the other hand, if the High Court is prima facie of the view that the substantial question of law involved would not require much time for disposal, the court is bound to frame the substantial question of law at the stage of admission and then order short notice.

**Doctrine of merger \-** The doctrine of merger is founded on the rationale that there cannot be more than one operative decree at a given point of time. The doctrine of merger applies irrespective of whether the appellate court has affirmed, modified or reversed the decree of the trial court- Once the High Court as an appellate court in second appeal renders its judgment it is a decree of the second appellate court which becomes executable hence, the entitlement of the decree holder to execute the decree of the second appellate court cannot be defeated. (Para 28\)

**Specific Relief Act \- Section 28 \-** The power under Section 28 of the Act is discretionary and the court cannot ordinarily annul the decree once passed by it. Although the power to annul the decree exists yet Section 28 of the Act provides for complete relief to both the parties in terms of the decree. The court does not cease to have the power to extend the time even though the trial court had earlier directed in the decree that payment of balance price to be made by certain date and on failure the suit to stand dismissed. (Para 26\)

**Specific Relief Act** \- A suit for specific performance does not come to an end on passing of a decree and the court which has passed the decree for specific performance retains the control over the decree even after the decree has been passed. The decree for specific performance has been described as a preliminary decree. (Para 25-26)

**Indian Penal Code 1860** \- Section 304B ; Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023- Section 80 \- For proving the offence of dowry death, the prosecution must prove that (i) the death of the woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or has occurred otherwise than in normal circumstances, (ii) the death has occurred within seven years of her marriage, (iii) soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his any relative and (iv) the cruelty or harassment was for or in connection with the demand for dowry. (Para 9\)

**Criminal Trial** \- Though the Investigating Officer collected the alleged admitted handwriting of the deceased, the said alleged handwriting, along with the letter, were not sent to a handwriting expert to secure his opinion. Therefore, an adverse inference needs to be drawn against the prosecution. (para 6\)

**Practice and Procedure \- Constitutional Courts** \- Issuing limited notice at the stage of admission does not bar a Constitutional Court having inherent powers to pass such orders as the justice of the case before it demands to enlarge the scope of a petition/appeal at the stage of final hearing. Any observation that the court may choose to make while entertaining the petition/appeal by issuing limited notice ought to be regarded as tentative. Such observation cannot limit the court’s jurisdiction to consider the controversy, as raised, in its entire perspective. Whether or not the court would enlarge the scope is, however, a question which is largely dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case. If the court seized of the petition/appeal considers that the justice of the case before it demands enlargement of the scope, notwithstanding that a limited notice had been issued earlier, the court’s powers are not fettered particularly when enforcement of any Fundamental/Constitutional right is urged by the party approaching it. (Para 19\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \- Disciplinary Proceedings \-** Administrative order punishing a delinquent employee is not ordinarily subject to correction in judicial review because the disciplinary authority is the sole judge of facts. If there is some legal evidence on which the findings can be based, then adequacy or even reliability of that evidence is not a matter for canvassing before the high court in a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. However, should on consideration of the materials on record, the court be satisfied that there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice, or that the inquiry proceedings have been conducted contrary to statutory regulations prescribing the mode of such inquiry, or that the ultimate decision of the disciplinary authority is vitiated by considerations extraneous to the evidence and merits of the case, or that the conclusion of the disciplinary authority is ex facie arbitrary or capricious, so much so that no reasonable person could have arrived at such conclusion, or there is any other ground very similar to the above, the high court may in the exercise of its discretion interfere to set things right. After all, public servants to whom Article 311 of the Constitution apply do enjoy certain procedural safeguards, enforcement of which by the high court can legitimately be urged by such servants depending upon the extent of breach that is manifestly demonstrated. (Para 34\) Validity of any disciplinary action, whenever questioned, has to be tested on the touchstone of Articles 14, 16 and 21 as well as Article 311(2), wherever applicable. To test whether interference is warranted, this Court has laid down that the scrutiny ought to be confined to finding out whether the disciplinary proceedings have been conducted fairly; if not, an inference can be drawn that this has caused prejudice to the charged employee. Be that as it may, there can be no gainsaying that the consequences of violation of a fair procedure, which principles of natural justice embody, in a given situation has to be considered on a case-by-case basis bearing in mind that judicial review is not intended to be an appeal in disguise. (Para 35\)

**Natural Justice** \- The traditional concept of natural justice comprises of the two rules that prohibit anyone from being condemned unheard and anyone from being a judge of his own cause \- In relation to disciplinary proceedings, subject to just exceptions, natural justice would envisage observance of procedural fairness before holding a public servant guilty of misconduct and imposing a punishment on him for such misconduct. While it is true that principles of natural justice supplement, and not supplant, the law, such principles have been declared by this Court to be a constituent feature of Article 14\. (Para 35\)

**Central Excise Act, 1944 \- Section 4** \- For applicability of clause (a) of Section 4(1), the following conditions must be fulfilled: a. The assessee sells the goods for delivery at time and place of the removal; b. The assessee and the buyer are not related; and c. The price is the sole consideration for the sale- Only if all three conditions are fulfilled, the value of the goods for the purpose of computation of excise duty will be the transaction value. In a given case, if it is not proved that the price was the sole consideration for sale, clause (a) of Section 4(1) would not apply. In that case, clause (b) of Section 4(1) would apply. (Para 23\)

**Central Excise Act, 1944 \- Section 11A** \- Under the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 11-A, an extended period of limitation can be invoked when there is a non- levy or non-payment or short levy or short payment of the excise duty by a reason of fraud or collusion or any wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts or contravention of any of the provisions of 1944 Act or the rules made thereunder with the intent to evade payment of duty.

**Constitution of India \- Article 136 \-** Since exercise of jurisdiction under Article 136 is discretionary, notices on appeals/petitions are not frequently issued by this Court. Nonetheless, if in a given case, notice is issued which is limited on terms but the party approaching the Court is otherwise persuasive in pointing out that the case does involve a substantial question of law deserving consideration and the Bench is so satisfied, we see no reason why the case may not be heard on such or other points. In such a case, the jurisdiction to decide all legal and valid points, as raised, does always exist and would not get diminished or curtailed by a limited notice issuing order. However, whether or not to exercise the power of enlarging the scope of the petition/appeal is essentially a matter in the realm of discretion of the Bench and the discretion is available to be exercised when a satisfaction is reached that the justice of the case so demands.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 306 : Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 \- Section 108** \- A remark such as asking the deceased to not be alive if she cannot live without marrying her lover will also not gain the status of abetment. There needs to be a positive act that creates an environment where the deceased is pushed to an edge in order to sustain the charge of Section 306 IPC (Para 14)- When Section 306 IPC is read with Section 107 IPC, it is clear that there must be (i) direct or indirect instigation; (ii) in close proximity to the commission of suicide; along with (iii) clear mens rea to abet the commission of suicide.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 300 : Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita \- Section 101- Exception 1 \-** Before Exception 1 can be invoked, the accused must establish the following circumstances: (i) there was a provocation which was both grave and sudden; (ii) such provocation had deprived the accused of his power of self-control; and (iii) whilst the accused was so deprived of his power of self-control, he had caused the death of the victim- **Sudden** \-(i) Whether the provocation was sudden or not does not present much difficulty. The word ‘sudden’ involves two elements. First, the provocation must be unexpected. If an accused plans in advance to receive a provocation in order to justify the subsequent homicide, the provocation cannot be said to be sudden. Secondly, the interval between the provocation and the homicide should be brief. If the man giving the provocation is killed within a minute after the provocation, it is a case of sudden provocation. If the man is killed six hours after the provocation, it is not a case of sudden provocation- **Grave** \-(ii) A bare statement by the accused that he regarded the provocation as grave will not be accepted by the court. The court has to apply an objective test for deciding whether the provocation was grave or not. A good test for deciding whether a certain provocation was grave or not is this: “Is a reasonable man likely to lose self-control as a result of such provocation?” If the answer is in the affirmative, the provocation will be classed as grave. If the answer is in the negative, the provocation is not grave. In this context, the expression ‘reasonable man’ means a normal or an average person. A reasonable man is not the ideal man or the perfect being. A normal man sometimes loses temper. There is, therefore no inconsistency in saying that, a reasonable man may lose self-control as a result of grave provocation. A reasonable or normal or average man is a legal fiction. The reasonable man will vary from society to society. A Judge should not impose his personal standards in this matter. By training, a Judge is a patient man. But the reasonable man or the normal man need not have the same standard of behaviour as the judge himself. The reasonable man under consideration is a member of the society, in which the accused was living. So, education and social conditions of the accused are relevant factors. An ordinary exchange of abuse is a matter of common occurrence. A reasonable man does not lose self-control merely on account of an ordinary exchange of abuses. So, courts do not treat an ordinary exchange of abuses as a basis for grave provocation. On the other hand, in most societies, adultery is looked upon as a very serious matter. So, quotes are prepared to treat adultery as a basis for grave provocation- (iii) **Loss of self-control \-** the question of loss of self-control comes up indirectly in deciding whether a particular provocation was grave or not. So, if it is proved that the accused did receive grave and sudden provocation, the court is generally prepared to assume that homicide was committed while the accused was deprived of the power of self-control. In some cases, it may be possible for the prosecution to prove that the accused committed the murder with a cool head in spite of grave provocation. But such cases will be rare. So, when the accused has established grave and sudden provocation, the court will generally hold that he has discharged the burden that lay upon him under Exception 1 to Section 300 IPC. (Para 17-26)

**Indian Evidence Act, 1872 \- Section 105 \- Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam \- Section 108 \-** It is for the accused who seeks to reduce the nature of his crime by bringing his case under Exception 1, to prove that the provocation received by him was such as might reasonably be deemed sufficient to deprive him of self- control, and that the act of killing took place whilst that absence of control was in existence and may fairly be attributed to it.

Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council, Medchal \- Malkajgiri that a writ petition could never be entertained against any order/award of the MSEFC, completely bars or prohibits maintainability of the writ petition before the High Court? (ii) If the bar/prohibition is not absolute, when and under what circumstances will the principle/restriction of adequate alternative remedy not apply? (iii) Whether the members of MSEFC who undertake conciliation proceedings, upon failure, can themselves act as arbitrators of the arbitral tribunal in terms of Section 18 of the MSMED Act read with Section 80 of the A\&C Act? The first and second question will subsume the question of when and in what situation a writ petition can be entertained against an order/award passed by MSEFC acting as an arbitral tribunal or conciliator.

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-**The access to High Courts by way of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, is not just a constitutional right but also a part of the basic structure. It is available to every citizen whenever there is a violation of their constitutional rights or even statutory rights. This is an inalienable right and the rule of availability of alternative remedy is not an omnibus rule of exclusion of the writ jurisdiction, but a principle applied by the High Courts as a form of judicial restraint and refrain in exercising the jurisdiction. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and the same is not limited by any provision of the Constitution and cannot be restricted or circumscribed by a statute- Writ courts, despite the availability of alternative remedies, may exercise writ jurisdiction at least in three contingencies – i) where there is a violation of principles of natural justice or fundamental rights; ii) where an order in a proceeding is wholly without jurisdiction; or iii) where the vires of an Act is challenged.

Section 12B is in the nature of a pre-condition for taking cognizance by a Court- as a complaint can be made/filed by an authorised officer alone under the Special Act i.e. the Aircrafts Act, 1934, before the concerned Court, the local police can only forward the material collected by it during the investigation to such authorised officer. It shall be open to the authorised officer to take a decision in accordance with law with regard to filing or non-filing of a complaint (Para 39-41)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \- In** exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code, it is open to the High Court to quash an FIR either to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice- An FIR can be quashed if the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused or where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings. (Para 30\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 336 \-** Section 336 IPC seeks to punish a person who does an act rashly or negligently and endangers human life or personal safety of others. To attract Section 336 IPC, the prosecution must allege that the accused did the act in question; that it was done rashly or negligently and that it was such as to endanger the life or personal safety of others. (Para 33\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 441,447 \-** Every trespass by itself is not criminal. To constitute criminal trespass the prosecution has to allege that the trespass was committed with one of the intents enumerated in Section 441 IPC. Accordingly, the prosecution has to prove that the complainant had possession of the property in question and that the accused entered into or upon the property; or after having lawfully entered unlawfully remained there with the intention (a) to commit an offence; or (b) to intimidate, insult, or annoy the person in possession. In the absence of any such allegation, the offence under Section 441/447 IPC cannot be sustained. (Para 35\)

**SARFAESI Act \- Section 17, 34 \-** In this case, the plaintiff in her suit has prayed for 3 reliefs: For a declaration that the sale deed executed by one Sumer Chand Jain in favour of Parmeshwar Das Prajapati is illegal (“first relief”) 2\. For a declaration that the mortgage deed executed by Parmeshwar Das Prajapati in favour of the Bank is illegal (“second relief”) 3\. For being handed over the possession (“third relief”) \- Civil Court Rejected the plaint holding that its jurisdiction is excluded by Section 34 SARFAESI Act \- HC set aside Civil Court's order \- Dismissing Appeal, SC observed:When reliefs sought in civil suit are in relation to the actions taken prior to the secured creditor stepping into the picture and well prior to the secured creditor invoking the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act to grant the declarations sought in the first and the second reliefs. (Para 16\) The SARFAESI Act has not been enacted for providing a mechanism for adjudicating upon the validity of documents or to determine questions of title finally- The jurisdiction to declare a sale deed or a mortgage deed being illegal is vested with the civil court under Section 9 CPC \- DRT can never have the jurisdiction to decide such civil disputes of title between a third person and a borrower. (Para 18-19)

**SARFAESI Act \- Section 17(3) \-** There is no power conferred on DRT to hand over the property to someone who was never in possession. (Para 23\)

**SARFAESI Act \- Section 17 (unamended) \-**While it is true that Section 17(1) uses the words “any person (including the borrower) aggrieved”, Section 17(3) does not explicitly empower the DRT to restore the possession to anyone other than the borrower. Yes, in a given case, if the borrower has put someone else in possession, then perhaps, it could be contended that under Section 17(3), the DRT’s power to restore possession to the “borrower” would include the power to restore possession to the person who was holding it on behalf of the borrower or claiming through the borrower. However, it cannot be contended that under Section 17(3), the DRT can hand over possession to someone whose claim is adverse to that of the borrower- Under Section 17(3), the DRT has the power to “restore” possession which would mean that it has the power to return possession to the person who was in possession when the bank took over possession. DRT only has power to “restore” possession; it has no power to “hand over” possession to a person who was never in possession when the bank took over possession. (Para 23\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order VII, Rule 11 \-** There cannot be a partial rejection of the plaint \-Even if one relief survives, the plaint cannot be rejected- If the civil court is of the view that one relief (say relief A) is not barred by law but is of the view that Relief B is barred by law, the civil court must not make any observations to the effect that relief B is barred by law and must leave that issue undecided in an Order VII, Rule 11 application. This is because if the civil court cannot reject a plaint partially, then by the same logic, it ought not to make any adverse observations against relief B. (Para 24-25)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 9-** The bar of jurisdiction of the civil court is not to be readily inferred. Such a provision requires strict interpretation \- Court would lean in favour of construction which would uphold the retention of the civil court's jurisdiction. (Para 43\)

**Banks \-** Banks should remain very careful with inadequate title clearance reports, more particularly, when such reports are obtained cheaply and at times for external reasons. This concerns the protection of public money and is in the larger public interest. Therefore, it is essential for the Reserve Bank of India and other stakeholders to collaborate in developing a standardized and practical approach for preparing title search report before sanctioning loans and also for the purpose of determining liability (including potential criminal action) of the Officer who approves loan. Additionally, there should be standard guidelines for fees and costs associated with title search reports so as to ensure that they maintain high quality. (Para 44\)

**NDPS Act \-** **Conscious possession \-** Possession under the NDPS Act should not only be physical but also conscious. Conscious possession implies that the person knew that he had the illicit drug or psychotropic substance in his control and had the intent or knowledge of its illegal nature- Conscious possession refers to a scenario where an individual not only physically possesses a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance but is also aware of its presence and nature. In other words, it requires both physical control and mental awareness. (Para 21\)

**NDPS Act** \- **Section 54** \- Unless and until the contrary is proved in trials of cases involving offences coming within the purview of the NDPS Act, it may be presumed that the accused has committed an offence under the Act in respect of any articles prohibited to be possessed by him and for the possession of which, he failed to account satisfactorily. Therefore, it is the burden of the prosecution to establish that the contraband was seized from the conscious possession of the accused. Only when that aspect has been successfully proved by the prosecution, the onus will shift to the accused to account for the possession legally and satisfactorily. (Para 16\)

**Criminal Trial \-** The law nowhere states that the evidence of the interested witness should be discarded altogether. The law only warrants that their evidence should be scrutinized with care and caution. It has been held by this Court in the catena of judgments that merely if a witness is a relative, their testimony cannot be discarded on that ground alone- In criminal cases, the credibility of witnesses, particularly those who are close relatives of the victim, is often scrutinized. However, being a relative does not automatically render a witness "interested" or biased. The term "interested" refers to witnesses who have a personal stake in the outcome, such as a desire for revenge or to falsely implicate the accused due to enmity or personal gain. A "related" witness, on the other hand, is someone who may be naturally present at the scene of the crime, and their testimony should not be dismissed simply because of their relationship to the victim. Courts must assess the reliability, consistency, and coherence of their statements rather than labelling them as untrustworthy. (para 27-29)

**Criminal Trial-** Conviction can be based upon the version put forth by the eyewitness and the medical evidence must be considered only for the purpose of corroboration of the ocular evidence. (Para 33\)

**Criminal Trial-** Minor contradictions or inconsistencies in testimony do not necessarily render it unreliable, as long as the core facts remain intact. The role of the court is to discern the truth by considering the evidence in its totality and not by isolating individual inconsistencies to discredit an entire narrative. (Para 35\) In order to render any witnesses’ testimony as unreliable, the inconsistencies shall be material ones and of such a nature that they create substantive doubts in the mind of the court towards the story or the chain of events as sought to be established by the prosecution. (Para 38\) the benefit of the doubt must be based on rational and cogent grounds. Mere conjectures or hypothetical inconsistencies cannot form the basis for acquittal when the evidence, viewed as a whole, points to the guilt of the accused. (Para 42\)

**Summary**: Supreme Court delivered split verdict in AIMIM candidate's plea for interim bail in Delhi Riots case.

**Interim Bail** \- Interim bail is not permissible for the purposes of contesting elections, much less for campaigning-Right to campaign or canvass is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional or a human right. It is not even a right recognized under any statute- The reasons and factors whereunder interim bail may be permitted may include cases where there is death in the family of the accused and the cremation has to take place; to attend the wedding of son/daughter or of any close relative of the accused but such a right has not been recognized on the plea of contesting or canvassing for the election. \- The grant of interim bail for contesting elections would mean permitting the accused to cast his/her vote, which would be antithesis to the provisions of Section 62(5) of the Representation of People Act, 1951- Distinguished [Arvind Kejriwal vs](https://www.caseciter.com/arvind-kejriwal-vs-enforcement-directorate-2024-insc-400-interim-bail-elections/) ED- There the petitioner was holding the post of Chief Minister and was the President of a national party and therefore, the Court opined that he is one of the main campaigners, which is not the situation in the case at hand. \[Para 9-19 of Justice Pankaj Mittal's order\] \-I do not doubt the propositions of law eloquently recorded in Brother Mithal’s opinion. \-Learned Brother Mithal has rightly opined that a Pandora’s Box cannot be permitted to be opened by letting a horde of convicts and/or undertrial prisoners seek release for the purpose of trying their luck at the electoral hustings. Likewise, the learned ASG’s apprehension that others, whether similarly- situated or not, may seek to (mis)use this Judgment, is not unjustified. (Para 25-34 of Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah's order)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 361,363-** an offence punishable under Section 361 IPC would be made out only when a person takes or entices any minor under the age of 16 years, if he is a male or under 18 years, if female. Section 361 IPC, defines kidnapping from lawful guardianship and Section 363 IPC provides a sentence for the offence of kidnapping a person from lawful guardianship- If the victim was above 18 years at the time of the alleged offence, the provision of Sections 361 and 363 IPC could not have been invoked. (Para 9-12) 

**Criminal Trial \- Test Identification Parade \-** While identification by a witness in a given case for the first time in witness box would be permissible, the substantial gap of approximately eight years raises serious concern regarding identification.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 323** \- For a conviction under Section 323 of the IPC, there must be a voluntary act of causing hurt, i.e., bodily pain, disease, or infirmity, to another person. Therefore, it is essential that actual hurt is caused. (Para 16\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 504**\- Mere act of insulting someone does not fulfil its requirements; the insult must be of such a nature that it provokes the person insulted to breach the public peace or engage in criminal conduct. Therefore, to establish the ingredients of Section 504 of the IPC, it must be demonstrated, based on the available material, that there was intentional insult with the intent or knowledge that such insult would provoke either disturbance of the public peace or the commission of any other offence. (Para 22\) When it is nowhere alleged that this act of using filthy language and insulting the complainant by the appellants, has provoked the complainant to commit breach of public peace or to commit any other offence, the ingredients of the offence under Section 504 are not satisfied.

**Criminal Trial \- Circumstantial Evidence** \-Conviction on a charge of murder may be based purely on circumstantial evidence, provided that such evidence is deemed credible and trustworthy. In cases involving circumstantial evidence, it is crucial to ensure that the facts leading to the conclusion of guilt are fully established and that all the established facts point irrefutably towards the accused person’s guilt. The chain of incriminating circumstances must be conclusive and should exclude any hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused- A court can convict an accused only if their guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt and not merely on the possibility of guilt. The gap between “may be guilty” and “must be guilty” is significant, separating uncertain speculations from definitive conclusions. Thus, it is the duty of the prosecution to elevate its case from the realm of ‘may be true’ to ‘must be true’- Every piece of relevant fact needs to be sewn via the golden thread of duly proved circumstances, in order to ultimately formulate the fabric of guilt.

**Summary**: HC dismissed Writ petition seeking direction to the State of Chhattisgarh to allow the appellant to bury his father at the same site where his ancestors were buried in the village of Chhindwada \- In appeal, SC delivered split verdict \- However, it disposed appeal by issuing following directions: (i) The appellant shall conduct the funeral rites and bury his deceased father at the burial ground at village Karkapal. (ii) The respondent-State and its local authorities shall ensure that the appellant and his family are provided with all logistical support for the purpose of transferring the body of the deceased from the mortuary at the Medical College situated in Jagdalpur to the Christian burial ground situated at village Karkapal, if so desired by the appellant. (iii) Adequate police protection shall be accorded in this regard. (iv) The respondent-State and its authorities shall ensure that the burial of the deceased father shall take place at the earliest.

**Justice SC Sharma's judgment** \- The fact that procedures pertaining to last rites; and ceremonies involved, from a part of the right(s) protected under Part III of the Constitution of India. However, to claim that such right(s) would encompass the unqualified right to choose the “place” of such ceremony (including burial) would prima facie appear to stretch constitutional limits beyond what was envisaged.

**Justice Nagarathna's judgment:** *It is said that death is a great leveller. It is necessary for us to remind ourselves time and again about this solemn truth*(Para 2\) \- Secularism together with the concept of fraternity, as envisaged under our Constitution, is a reflection of harmony between all religious faiths leading to common brotherhood and unity of the social fabric in the country. It is therefore incumbent on all citizens as well as institutions, whether of governance or otherwise, to foster fraternity amongst the citizens. It is brotherhood and fraternity among citizens which would make the country stronger and more cohesive given the diversity of the land and the need for unity. (Para 22.11)

**Death Sentence \-** The imposition of capital punishment is an exception and not the rule. Even where multiple murders have been committed, if there is evidence or at least a reasonable possibility of reform, a lesser sentence must be preferred \- In this case, the Appellant was convicted for the murders of his wife and four minor daughters \-While commuting death sentence, SC observed: We must scrutinize not only the nature of the offence but also the totality of the offender’s circumstances \- While the offence is undoubtedly brutal, certain mitigating factors, especially the Appellant’s lack of criminal antecedents and his reported conduct in prison, tilt the scales in favour of commutation. There is no material demonstrating that he would remain a perpetual threat to society or that he is beyond reform. Indeed, the Probation Officer’s input and the Superintendent of District Jail’s report show a potentially reformable individual- while the crime is heinous and deserves the highest degree of condemnation, it does not meet the threshold of “the rarest of rare” so as to irrevocably foreclose the option of life imprisonment- IPC, we consider it appropriate to commute the death sentence to one of life imprisonment till his last breath. (Para 21\)

**Indian Evidence Act** \- Section 112 \-Legitimacy determines paternity under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, until the presumption is successfully rebutted by proving ‘non-access’ (Para 70\) The contention that ‘paternity’ and ‘legitimacy’ are distinct or independent concepts is a misdirected notion \- An ‘additional’ access or ‘multiple’ access does not automatically negate the access between the spouses and prove non-access thereof- There exists a strong presumption that the husband is the father of the child borne by his wife during the subsistence of their marriage. This section provides that conclusive proof of legitimacy is equivalent to paternity \- Access and non-access under Section 112 do not require a party to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they had or did not have sexual intercourse at the time the child could have been begotten. ‘Access’ merely refers to the possibility of an opportunity for marital relations \- In such a scenario, while parties may be on non-speaking terms, engaging in extra-marital affairs, or residing in different houses in the same village, it does not necessarily preclude the possibility of the spouses having an opportunity to engage in marital relations- Non-access means the impossibility, not merely inability, of the spouses to have marital relations with each other. (Para 32-33)

**Indian Evidence Act \- Section 112 \- DNA Test** \- When dealing with the eminent need for a DNA test to prove paternity, this Court balances the interests of those involved and must consider whether it is possible to reach the truth without the use of such a test.- First and foremost, the courts must, therefore, consider the existing evidence to assess the presumption of legitimacy. If that evidence is insufficient to come to a finding, only then should the court consider ordering a DNA test. Once the insufficiency of evidence is established, the court must consider whether ordering a DNA test is in the best interests of the parties involved and must ensure that it does not cause undue harm to the parties. There are thus, two blockades to ordering a DNA test: (i) insufficiency of evidence; and (ii) a positive finding regarding the balance of interests.

**Family Courts Act, 1984 \- Section 7-8** \-Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction over a suit or proceeding for a declaration as to the legitimacy of a person. However, the Family Court cannot entertain any proceedings for a declaration of legitimacy without a claim on the marital relationship.

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 11 \-**The principle of res judicata is a salutary and pragmatic edict to reinforce the doctrine of finality. When a matter, whether on a question of fact or question of law, has been decided between two parties in a suit and the decision is final, neither party will be allowed to canvass the matter again in a future suit or proceeding. Without this bar, parties would be immobilized for all eternity, due to the uncertainty regarding their rights and entitlements. Res judicata infuses predictability in legal adjudication. The courts are thus, under a bounden duty to enforce this statutory embargo where the facts of the case overwhelmingly satisfy the ingredients of Section 11 of the CPC. (Para 65\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 12, 226 \-** Although a non-banking finance company is duty bound to follow and abide by the guidelines provided by the Reserve Bank of India for smooth conduct of its affairs in carrying on its business, yet those are of regulatory measures to keep a check and provide guideline and not a participatory dominance or control over the affairs of the company- body \- It has no duty towards the public. Its duty is towards its account holders, which may include the borrowers having availed of the loan facility. It has no power to take any action, or pass any order affecting the rights of the members of the public. The binding nature of its orders and actions is confined to its account holders and borrowers and to its employees. Its functions are also not akin to Governmental functions. (Para 7\) \- A private company carrying on banking business as a Scheduled bank cannot be termed as a company carrying on any public function or public duty. (Para 9\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** For issuing writ against a legal entity, it would have to be an instrumentality or agency of a State or should have been entrusted with such functions as are Governmental or closely associated therewith by being of public importance or being fundamental to the life of the people and hence Governmental- A writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India may be maintainable against (i) the State Government; (ii) Authority; (iii) a statutory body; (iv) an instrumentality or agency of the State; (v) a company which is financed and owned by the State; (vi) a private body run substantially on State funding; (vii) a private body discharging public duty or positive obligation of public nature; and (viii) a person or a body under liability to discharge any function under any Statute, to compel it to perform such a statutory function.- Normally, mandamus is issued to a public body or authority to compel it to perform some public duty cast upon it by some statute or statutory rule. In exceptional cases a writ of mandamus or a writ in the nature of mandamus may issue to a private body, but only where a public duty is cast upon such private body by a statute or statutory rule and only to compel such body to perform its public duty.-Merely because a statue or a rule having the force of a statute requires a company or some other body to do a particular thing, it does not possess the attribute of a statutory body \- If a private body is discharging a public function and the denial of any rights is in connection with the public duty imposed on such body, the public law remedy can be enforced. The duty cast on the public body may be either statutory or otherwise and the source of such power is immaterial but, nevertheless, there must be the public law element in such action- According to Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Ed. Vol.30, p.682, “a public authority is a body not necessarily a county council, municipal corporation or other local authority which has public statutory duties to perform, and which perform the duties and carries out its transactions for the benefit of the public and not for private profit”. There cannot be any general definition of public authority or public action. The facts of each case decide the point. (Para 9\)

**Protection of rights of domestic workers**\- Domestic workers in India remain largely unprotected and without any comprehensive legal recognition. As a result, they frequently endure low wages, unsafe environments, and extended hours without effective recourse \- Govt. of India directed to jointly constitute a Committee comprising subject experts to consider the desirability of recommending a legal framework for the benefit, protection and regulation of the rights of domestic workers- We once again repose our faith in the Legislature, and the elected representatives of the Indian people, to take the imperative steps towards ensuring an equitable and dignified life for domestic workers. (Para 41-55)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482-** High Court, in exercising its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the CrPC, may issue orders to prevent the abuse of court processes or to secure the ends of justice. These inherent powers are neither controlled nor limited by any other statutory provision. However, given the broad and profound nature of this authority, the High Court must exercise it sparingly. The conditions for invoking such powers are embedded within Section 482 of the CrPC itself, allowing the High Court to act only in cases of clear abuse of process or where intervention is essential to uphold the ends of justice. (Para 8\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 343** \- This offence requires the satisfaction of two prongs: (i) the voluntary restraint of any person; and (ii) the act being done in a manner such that it prevents the said person from proceeding beyond circumscribing limits. (Para 12\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 120B \-** principal ingredient of this offence is the agreement to commit an offence.6 The charge of conspiracy must be explicitly evidenced, and should be easily discernable in the acts of the conspiring parties. This Court has also previously held, in no uncertain terms, that conspiracy cannot be made out without some kind of physical manifestation of the alleged agreement being established. (Para 22\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 320** \-A delicate balance ought to be struck in cases wherein the parties seek compounding of the offences. Though well- intentioned, an excessively moralistic order may unnecessarily prolong criminal proceedings, which have no logical conclusion and only serve to further distress the parties. (Para 32\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 227** \- The discharge stage acts as a critical filter to eliminate cases lacking legal merit, sparing the accused from unnecessary proceedings, while ensuring that credible cases proceed to trial. Thus, discharge under Section 227 of the CrPC is justified when the material on record fails to disclose a prima facie case against the accused to proceed for trial. The legislative spirit behind this provision envisions the rights of the accused being balanced with public interest, so as to ultimately prevent abuse of the legal process. (Para 34\)

**Separation of powers** \- Ordinarily, the judiciary should not stray too far out of bounds, and expressly interfere in the legislative domain. The democratic setup of this country may be likened to a tripartite machine, fueled by the doctrine of separation of powers, without which its functioning shall surely come to a grinding halt.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 372 Proviso \-** The ‘proviso’ is a substantive enactment, and is not merely excepting something out of or qualifying what was excepting or goes before. Therefore, by adding the ‘proviso’ in Section 372 of CrPC by this amendment, a right has been created in favour of the victim \-The proviso establishes an independent right and is not an exception to Section 372, but a stand-alone legal provision. The amendment made in Section 372 CrPC by adding a proviso in the year 2009 creating a substantive right of appeal is not retrospective in nature.(Para 54-72)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 154 \- Code of Criminal Procedure \- Section 161,162,164 \-** the material elicited as contradiction by use of Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act is not substantive evidence. Even in regard to the statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC by authorised Magistrate, it has been held accordingly- Therefore, the fact that the contradictions are proved through the investigating officers though the witnesses have denied having made such statements, does not translate the contradictions into substantive evidence. Unless there is substantive evidence, it cannot be acted upon legally particularly to base a conviction. (Para 81\) \- The phrase 'if duly proved' in Section 162 of the CrPC indicates that the statements of witnesses recorded by the police cannot be immediately admitted as evidence or examined. They must first be proven through eliciting admissions from the witness during cross-examination and also during the cross-examination of the Investigating Officer. While statements made to the Investigating Officer can be used for contradiction, this can only be done after strict compliance with Section 145 of the Evidence Act. This requires drawing attention to the specific parts of the statement intended for contradiction. This is what is required under Section 145 of the Evidence Act but even where a witness is confronted by his previous statement and given an opportunity to explain that part of the statement that is put to him does not constitute substantive evidence. (Para 80\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 20-22 \-** The right to consult an advocate of choice shall not be denied to any person who is arrested. This does not mean that persons who are not under arrest or custody can be denied such right- The service of a lawyer shall be available for consultation to the accused person under circumstances of near custodial interrogation. Moreover, the right against self-incrimination is best practiced & best promoted by conceding to the accused, the right to consult a legal practitioner of his choice. Lawyers’ presence is a constitutional claim in some circumstances of our country, and in the context of Article 20(3), is an assurance of awareness and observance of the right to silence. (Para 45\)

**Legal Maxim \- "Actus curiae neminem gravabit” \-** Judicial actions should not unfairly harm any party and that courts should act judiciously to prevent errors that could lead to injustice."There is no higher principle for the guidance of the court than the one that no act of courts should harm a litigant and it is the bounden duty of the courts to see that if a person is harmed by a mistake of the court he should be restored to the position he would have occupied, but for that mistake." (Para 4-5)

**Public Prosecutors \-** State Governments across the country appoint AGPs and APPs in their respective High Courts solely on political considerations. Favouritism and nepotism is one additional factor for compromising merit \- The AGPs and APPs in respective High Courts should be appointed solely on the merit of the person. The State Government owes a duty to ascertain the ability of the person; how proficient the person is in law, his overall background, his integrity etc- Role of Public Prosecutors explained (Para 92-98)

**Constitution of India \- Article 14** \- Residence-based reservation is impermissible in PG Medical courses \- Reservation at the higher level on the basis of ‘residence’ would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India- If such a reservation is permitted then it would be an invasion on the fundamental rights of several students, who are being treated unequally simply for the reasons that they belong to a different State in the Union \- However, the benefit of ‘reservation’ in educational institutions including medical colleges to those who reside in a particular State can be given to a certain degree only in MBBS courses. (Para 31\)

**Domicile \-**The purpose for which domicile is used by Governments is like a substitute for ‘permanent residence’ or a ‘permanent home’. Yet ‘domicile’ is primarily a legal concept for the purposes of determining what is the ‘personal law’ applicable to an individual. Therefore, even if an individual has no permanent residence or permanent home, he is still invested with a ‘domicile’ albeit by law or implication of law- The concept of domicile acquires importance only when within a country there are different laws or more precisely different systems of law operating. But this is not the case in India. Each citizen of this country carries with him or her, one single domicile which is the ‘Domicile of India’. The concept of regional or provincial domicile is alien to the Indian legal system. (Para 19\) We are all domiciled in the territory of India. We are all residents of India. Our common bond as citizens and residents of one country gives us the right not only to choose our residence anywhere in India, but also gives us the right to carry on trade & business or a profession anywhere in India.

**Natural Justice** \-Whether the denial of natural justice at the initial stage can be cured by an appellate body? concluded that a defect at the initial stage cannot generally be cured at the appellate stage. Even in cases where a ‘full jurisdiction’ may be available at the appellate stage, the Courts must have the discretion to relegate it to the original stage for an opportunity of hearing. (Para 67\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** The courts under its writ jurisdiction do not interfere with selections made by expert bodies by reassessing the comparative merits of the candidates. Interference with selections is limited to decisions vitiated by bias, malafides and violation of statutory provisions. Additionally, this Court has also held that administrative action can be reviewed on the ground of proportionality if it affects fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. (Para 16\)

**Natural Justice \-** The principle of audi alteram partem is the cornerstone of justice, ensuring that no person is condemned unheard. This principle transforms justice from a mere technical formality into a humane pursuit. It safeguards against arbitrary decision-making, and is needed more so in cases of unequal power dynamics \- An allegation of bias, can only be proved if facts are established after giving an opportunity of hearing. This process requires a fair and transparent procedure in which the concerned parties are given an adequate opportunity to present their case. Such an opportunity allows the accused party or the affected individuals to respond to the allegations, provide evidence, and clarify any misgivings regarding the decision-making process. Therefore, for an allegation of bias to be proved, it is imperative that the procedural safeguards of a fair hearing are observed allowing for establishment of the relevant facts.

Abdul Samad vs. State of Telangana](https://www.caseciter.com/mohd-abdul-samad-vs-state-of-telangana-2024-insc-506-s-125-crpc-muslim-women/) \- Social welfare provisions must be subjected to an expansive and beneficial construction- In this case, the issue raised was: Whether a woman is entitled to claim maintenance u/s. 125 CrPC from her second husband while her first marriage is allegedly legally subsisting? Distinguished judgments in Yamunabai Anantrao Adhav vs. Anantrao Shivram Adhav and Another (1988) 1 SCC 530 and Bakulabai and Another vs. Gangaram and Another (1988) 1 SCC 537 which denied maintenance in cases of subsisting marriages- Plea of separation from the first marriage was not made in those cases and hence, they are factually distinguishable- when the social justice objective of maintenance u/s. 125CrPC is considered against the particular facts and circumstances of this case, we cannot, in good conscience, deny maintenance to Appellant \- The Court also noted: Respondent knowingly entered into a marriage with Appellant not once, but twice. While MoU of Separation is not a legal decree of divorce, it also emerges from this document and other evidence that the parties have dissolved their ties, they have been living separately and Appellant is not deriving maintenance from her first husband. Therefore, barring the absence of a legal decree, Appellant is de facto separated from her first husband and is not deriving any rights and entitlements as a consequence of that marriage.

**Tanneries**\- tanneries are among the most polluting industries and the damage caused by them by discharging untreated or partially treated effluents into the River Palar and surrounding areas, has resulted in irreversible damage to the water bodies, groundwater, and agricultural lands. This environmental degradation has impoverished local farmers and has caused immense suffering to the local residents and the tannery workers, thereby endangering public health and life \- Directions issued.

**Environmental Law \-** Three foundational principles **(i) Doctrine of Public Trust** \- vital natural resources such as rivers, seashores, forests, and air are held in trust by the State for the benefit and enjoyment of the public. This doctrine places a fiduciary duty on governments to protect them from privatization or exploitation that compromises public interests. It imposes three key restrictions viz., (a)resources must remain accessible for public use, (b)cannot be sold for private gain, and (c)must be preserved in their natural state. Courts internationally, have extended its scope to protect wetlands, riparian forests, and ecologically fragile lands, emphasizing the need for environmental preservation in light of modern ecological challenges-**(ii) Principle of Sustainable Development-** The doctrine of sustainable development was evolved to strike a balance between economic advancement and environmental safeguards. It envisions development that can be sustained by nature / environment. While the advancement of industries and infrastructure is indispensable for fostering employment and generating revenue, such growth cannot come at the cost of irreparable ecological damage-**(iii) Right to healthy environment** \- Right to life inherently includes the right to enjoy, pollution free environment, which are essential for the full enjoyment of life. If anything endangers or impairs the quality of life in derogation of laws, a citizen has the right to have recourse to Article 32 of the Constitution to address the pollution of environment which may be detrimental to the quality of life. The concept of ‘right to healthy environment’ as part of the ‘right to life’ under Article 21 \- The ‘right to clean drinking water’ as a fundamental right. Infact, environmental rights, which encompass a group of collective rights, are now described as “third generation” rights. Therefore, the State, so as to sustain its claim of functioning for the welfare of its citizens, is bound to regulate water supply by safeguarding, maintaining and restoring the water bodies to protect the right to healthy water and prevent health hazards \-The States shall ensure that the water bodies are free from encroachments and steps must be taken to restore the water bodies. (Para 60-64)

**Polluters pay principle-** The universal principle followed for fastening liability on the polluter for the proportionate damage caused to the environment, resulting in violation of right to clean and healthy environment as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India \-When an activity is inherently hazardous or dangerous, the individual or entity engaging in such activity bears absolute liability for any harm caused, regardless of the care exercised. Polluting industries, therefore, are under an obligation to fully compensate for the damage caused to affected communities \- Polluter Pays Principle extended beyond compensating victims of pollution; it included the cost of reversing environmental degradation, in other words, they are required to undertake all necessary remedial measures to remove pollutants and restore the environment. This principle, along with the Precautionary Principle, has been recognized as part of the law of the land, drawing strength from Article 21 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. It underscores that environmental protection is not merely a regulatory obligation but a constitutional imperative aimed at safeguarding the fundamental rights of individuals and preserving ecological balance. (Para 71\)

**Government Pay Principle \-** While polluters bear absolute liability to compensate for environmental damage, the Governments (both Union and State) share an equally significant responsibility to prevent environmental degradation and ensure the implementation of effective remedial action- In situations where authorities fail to regulate polluters adequately, the resultant environmental degradation underscores a shared responsibility. The ‘Government Pay Principle’ emerges from this context, aiming to hold governments accountable for regulatory and enforcement lapses. (Para 82-83)

**Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 \- Section 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s)** \-For constituting an offence, it has to be established that the accused intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view. Similarly, for constituting an offence under Section 3(1)(s) of the SC-ST Act, it will be necessary that the accused abuses any member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe by caste name in any place within public view- To be a place ‘within public view’, the place should be open where the members of the public can witness or hear the utterance made by the accused to the victim. If the alleged offence takes place within the four corners of the wall where members of the public are not present, then it cannot be said that it has taken place at a place within public view. \[Referred to Swaran Singh v. State (2008) 8 SCC 435 and Hitesh Verma v. State of Uttarakhand (2020) 10 SCC 710 \] (Para 9-11)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \-** The power under Section 482 of the CrPC is required to be exercised sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases- The court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint. However, the court would be justified in exercising its discretion if the case falls under any of the clauses carved out by this Court in Paragraph 102 in the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335\. (para 17\)

**Summary**: SC quashed criminal proceedings under SC-ST Act \- In this case that when the complainant was in his office the accused came there; enquired with the complainant; not being satisfied, started abusing him in the name of his caste; and insulted him. Thereafter, three colleagues of the complainant came there, pacified the accused and took him away. It is thus clear that even as per the FIR, the incident has taken place within the four corners of the chambers of the complainant. The other colleagues of the complainant arrived at the scene after the occurrence of the incident- that since the incident has not taken place at a place which can be termed to be a place within public view, the offence would not come under the provisions of either Section 3(1)(r) or Section 3(1)(s) of the SC-ST Act.

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 113B \-** The presumption under Section 113-B will apply when it is established that soon before her death, the woman has been subjected by the accused to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry. Therefore, even for attracting Section 113-B, the prosecution must establish that the deceased was subjected by the appellant to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand of dowry soon before her death. Unless these facts are proved, the presumptions under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act cannot be invoked. (Para 8\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 304B** \- Essential ingredients : a) The death of a woman must have been caused by any burns or bodily injury, or must have occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances; b) The death must have been caused within seven years of her marriage; c) Soon before her death, she must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by the husband or any relative of her husband; and d) Cruelty or harassment must be for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry- If the aforesaid four ingredients are established, the death can be called a dowry death, and the husband and/or husband's relative, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have caused the dowry death. Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 provides that dowry means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage or by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to the other party to the marriage or to any other person. The dowry must be given or agreed to be given at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties. The term valuable security used in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 has the same meaning as in Section 30 of IPC. (Para 7\) Section 304-B of the IPC was brought on the statute book in 1986\. This Court has repeatedly laid down and explained the ingredients of the offence under Section 304-B. But, the Trial Courts are committing the same mistakes repeatedly. It is for the State Judicial Academies to step in. (Para 17\)

**Summary**: SC allowed appeal and set aside concurrent conviction of appellant under Section 498A and 304B IPC.

Even if such a power to amend is reserved in the advertisement or the rules, it must be tested on the anvil of Article 14 and pass the test of non–arbitrariness. (Para 55\)

**NCTE Guidelines** \- For a school covered by para 10(b)(i) & (ii), discretion has been conferred to accept the TET certificate awarded by another State/UT. But for the same school, if the State decides not to conduct TET, then discretion has been given to consider the TET conducted by the Central Government for eligibility. (Para 48\)

**Education** \- To educate is not merely to impart information, but to instil the ability to think critically, to inspire curiosity and to foster the love of learning. By imparting knowledge and life skills, teachers shape the foundation for lifelong learning and responsible citizenship. The importance of education and the paramount role of teachers in today’s day and age cannot be underplayed. (Para 1\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 156(3) \- Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 \- Section 175(3)** \- Three prominent changes that have been introduced by the enactment of BNSS: First, the requirement of making an application to the Superintendent of Police upon refusal by the officer in charge of a police station to lodge the FIR has been made mandatory, and the applicant making an application under Section 175(3) is required to furnish a copy of the application made to the Superintendent of Police under Section 173(4), supported by an affidavit, while making the application to the Magistrate under Section 175(3). b. Secondly, the Magistrate has been empowered to conduct such enquiry as he deems necessary before making an order directing registration of FIR. c. Thirdly, the Magistrate is required to consider the submissions of the officer in charge of the police station as regards the refusal to register an FIR before issuing any directions under Section 175(3)- The changes introduced by Section 175(3) of the BNSS to the existing scheme of Section 156(3) merely codify the procedural practices and safeguards which have been introduced by judicial decisions aimed at curbing the misuse of invocation of powers of a Magistrate by unscrupulous litigants for achieving ulterior motives- Further, by requiring the Magistrate to consider the submissions made by the concerned police officer before proceeding to issue directions under Section 175(3), BNSS has affixed greater accountability on the police officer responsible for registering FIRs under Section 173\. Mandating the Magistrate to consider the submissions of the concerned police officer also ensures that the Magistrate applies his mind judicially while considering both the complaint and the submissions of the police officer thereby ensuring that the requirement of passing reasoned orders is complied with in a more effective and comprehensive manner.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 156(3) \-** Whenever any application is filed by the complainant before the Court of Judicial Magistrate seeking police investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., it is the duty of the concerned Magistrate to apply his mind for the purpose of ascertaining whether the allegations levelled in the complaint constitute any cognizable offence or not. In other words, the Magistrate may not undertake the exercise to ascertain whether the complaint is false or otherwise, however, the Magistrate is obliged before he proceeds to pass an order for police investigation to closely consider whether the necessary ingredients to constitute the alleged offence are borne out on plain reading of the complaint. (Para 11\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 294** \- The act of a police officer assaulting the complainant within public view or public \- Obscene act for the purpose of Section 294 has a particular meaning. Mere abusive, humiliating or defamatory words by themselves are not sufficient to attract the offence under Section 294 of the IPC. (Para 15\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 504,506 \-**Quoted from Mohammad Wajid v. State of U.P. (Para 18\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 200,156(3) \-** It is not necessary that in every case where a complaint has been filed under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. the Magistrate should direct the Police to investigate the crime merely because an application has also been filed under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. even though the evidence to be led by the complainant is in his possession or can be produced by summoning witnesses, with the assistance of the court or otherwise. The issue of jurisdiction also becomes important at that stage and cannot be ignored. (Para 24\) If the allegations made in the complaint are simple, where the Court can straightaway proceed to conduct the trial, the Magistrate is expected to record evidence and proceed further in the matter, instead of passing the buck to the Police under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. Ofcourse, if the allegations made in the complaint require complex and complicated investigation which cannot be undertaken without active assistance and expertise of the State machinery, it would only be appropriate for the Magistrate to direct investigation by the police authorities. The Magistrate is, therefore, not supposed to act merely as a Post Office and needs to adopt a judicial approach while considering an application seeking investigation by the Police. (Para 25\)

**Summary**: SC set aside order passed by the Magistrate directing police investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C.

We find that the appellant would be entitled to the benefit of Exception 4 of Section 300 of the IPC. As such, the conviction of the appellant under Part I of Section 304 IPC would meet the ends of justice.

**Constitution of India \- Article 22 \- Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 57 \- PMLA \- Section 45, 65** \- The requirement of clause 2 of Article 22 has been incorporated in Section 57 CrPC \- There is no inconsistency between the provisions of the PMLA and Section 57 of Cr.P.C. Hence, by virtue of Section 65 of the PMLA, Section 57 of the Cr.P.C applies to the proceedings under the PMLA. (Para 7\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 21,22- Bail** \- The continuation of the accused in custody without producing him before the nearest Magistrate within the stipulated time of 24 hours is completely illegal and it infringes fundamental rights under clause 2 of Article 22 of the Constitution of India- Since there is a violation of Article 22(2) of the Constitution, even his fundamental right to liberty guaranteed under Article 21 has been violated- Once a Court, while dealing with a bail application, finds that the fundamental rights of the accused under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India have been violated while arresting the accused or after arresting him, it is the duty of the Court dealing with the bail application to release the accused on bail. The reason is that the arrest in such cases stands vitiated. It is the duty of every Court to uphold the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution. (Para 6-9)

**Labour Law \-** SC judgment in *Secretary, State of Karnataka vs. Umadevi* (2006) 4 SCC cannot serve as a shield to justify exploitative engagements persisting for years without the Employer undertaking legitimate recruitment- *Uma Devi* itself distinguishes between appointments that are “illegal” and those that are “irregular,” the latter being eligible for regularization if they meet certain conditions \- jurisprudence. Indian labour law strongly disfavors perpetual daily-wage or contractual engagements in circumstances where the work is permanent in nature. Morally and legally, workers who fulfil ongoing municipal requirements year after year cannot be dismissed summarily as dispensable, particularly in the absence of a genuine contractor agreement \- Quoted from in [Jaggo v. Union of India](https://www.caseciter.com/jaggo-vs-union-of-india-2024-insc-1034-service-law-regularization-uma-devi-judgment/). (Para 15\)

**U.P. Industrial Disputes Act \- Section 6E, 6N** \- Whether an individual is classified as regular or temporary is irrelevant as retrenchment obligations under the Act must be met in all cases attracting Section 6N. Any termination thus effected without statutory safeguards cannot be undertaken lightly.

**Labour Law \- Rights of employees \-** While concerns of municipal budget and compliance with recruitment rules merit consideration, such concerns do not absolve the Employer of statutory obligations or negate equitable entitlements. Indeed, bureaucratic limitations cannot trump the legitimate rights of workmen who have served continuously in de facto regular roles for an extended period (Para 17)- **Equal pay for equal work**\- The principle of “equal pay for equal work,” cannot be casually disregarded when workers have served for extended periods in roles resembling those of permanent employees. Long-standing assignments under the Employer’s direct supervision belie any notion that these were mere short-term casual engagements. (Para 13\)

**Criminal Trial \- Robbery** \- In cases where the FIR is lodged against unknown persons, and the persons made accused are not known to the witnesses, material collected during investigation plays an important role to determine whether there is a credible case against the accused. In such cases, the courts have to meticulously examine the evidence regarding (a) how the investigating agency derived clue about the involvement of the accused in the crime; (b) the manner in which the accused was arrested; and (c) the manner in which the accused was identified. Apart from above, discovery/ recovery of any looted article on the disclosure made by, or at the instance of, the accused, or from his possession, assumes importance to lend credence to the prosecution case.

Application that sought clarification that this judgment is to be applied prospectively- SC dismissed M.A. and observed- Rendering the decision in Tarsem Singh as prospective would create a situation where a landowner whose land was acquired on 31.12.2014 would be denied the benefit of ‘solatium’ and ‘interest’, whereas a landowner whose land was acquired the very next day, 01.01.2015-the date on which the Ordinance was promulgated, to read the 2013 Act into the NHAI Act, would be entitled to these statutory benefits \- Principles established in Tarsem Singh regarding the beneficial nature of granting ‘solatium’ and ‘interest’ reaffirmed while emphasising the need to avoid creating unjust classifications lacking intelligible differentia.

**Indian Evidence Act, 1872 \- Section 24 \- Extra Judicial Confession-** Confession may be divided into two classes i.e. judicial and extrajudicial. Judicial confessions are those which are made before a magistrate or a court in the course of judicial proceedings. Extra-judicial confessions are those which are made by the party elsewhere than before a magistrate or a court. Extra-judicial confessions are generally those that are made by a party before a private individual who may be a judicial officer also in his private capacity. As to extra-judicial confessions, two questions arise: firstly, whether they are made voluntarily and secondly, are they true? If the court is of the opinion that the confession was not made voluntarily but was a result of an inducement, threat or promise, it would not be acted upon. It follows that a confession would be voluntary if it is made by the accused in a fit state of mind and if it is not caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against him proceeding from a person in authority. Whether or not the confession was voluntary would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case judged in the light of Section 24 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872- Evidentiary value of an extra-judicial confession discussed \- Extra-judicial confession of an offence made by the accused before a witness is one of the several instances of circumstantial evidence; there are other circumstances, such as, the theory of last seen together; conduct of the accused before or immediately after the incident; human blood being found on the clothes or person of the accused which matches with that of the accused; leading to discovery, recovery of weapon etc. (Para 16- 19\)

**Criminal Trial \- Circumstantial Evidence \-** Where a case rests squarely on circumstantial evidence, inference of guilt can be justified only when all the incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any other person. The circumstances would not only have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, those would also have to be shown to be closely connected with the principal fact sought to be inferred from those circumstances. All these circumstances should be complete and there should be no gap left in the chain of evidence. The proved circumstances must be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with his innocence. The circumstances taken cumulatively must be so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else. While there is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence. If the evidence relied upon is reasonably capable of two inferences, the one in favour of the accused must be accepted. (Para 16\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 301** \- **Doctrine of transfer of malice or the transmigration of motive**\- Culpable homicide may be committed by causing death of a person whom the offender neither intended nor knew himself to be likely to kill. If the killing takes place in the course of doing an act which a person intends or knows to be likely to cause death, it must be treated as if the real intention of the killer had been actually carried out \- Under the Section, if A intends to kill B, but kills C whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the intention to kill C is by law attributed to him. If A aims his shot at B, but it misses B either because B moves out of the range of the shot or because the shot misses the mark and hits some other person C, whether within sight or out of sight, under Section 301, A is deemed to have hit C with the intention to kill him. What is to be noticed is that to invoke Section 301 of the IPC, A shall not have any intention to cause the death or the knowledge that he is likely to cause the death of C. \- Referred to Gyanendra Kumar v.

**Disciplinary proceedings \-**In disciplinary proceedings, it is not necessary for the Disciplinary Authority to deal with each and every ground raised by the delinquent officer in the representation against the proposed penalty and detailed reasons are not required to be recorded in the order imposing punishment if he accepts the findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer (Para 32\) All that is required on the part of the Disciplinary Authority is that it should examine the evidence in the disciplinary proceedings and arrive at a reasoned conclusion that the material placed on record during the course of enquiry establishes the guilt of the delinquent employee on the principle of preponderance of probabilities. (Para 33\) In a disciplinary enquiry, the burden upon the department is limited and it is required to prove its case on the principle of preponderance of probabilities. (Para 34\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** In an intra-court writ appeal, the Appellate Court must restrain itself and the interference into the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge is permissible only if the judgment of the learned Single Judge is perverse or suffers from an error apparent in law. (Para 37\)

**Disciplinary proceedings** \- Strict rules of evidence prohibiting admissibility of confessional statements recorded by the police officials do not apply. Likewise, non-examination of the decoy cannot be treated to be fatal in the domestic enquiry where other evidence indicts the delinquent officer \-Even a confession of the delinquent employee recorded by the Trap Laying Officer during the criminal investigation can be relied upon by the Disciplinary Authority.

**Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation and Certain Other Law (Amendment) Act, 2003- Section 3**\- Section 3 which repeals the KCCA Act, is constitutional \- The rationale underlying the 2003 Repeal Act is sound and consistent with the principles of legislative power. The arguments advanced that the repeal would amount to an impermissible overruling of prior Supreme Court decisions, that it violates the requirement of presidential assent, or that it is otherwise beyond the legislative competence of the State, are untenable. (Para 17\)

**Motor Vehicles Act \- Section 68(5) ;** **KMV Rules, 198 \- Rule 56(1)(d)-** The State Transport Authority (STA) possesses the power to delegate its functions under Section 68(5) of the MV Act, as expressly provided by the statute and further clarified by Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules- The delegation is a rational and necessary administrative measure that facilitates prompt and efficient processing of permit applications without undermining the oversight function of the STA. (Para 27-28)

**Legislation** \- The power to repeal a law is coextensive with the power to enact it. (Para 10\) A repeal statute does not recreate the legal framework anew but rather extinguishes the earlier Act’s operative provisions; it is not subject to the same procedural requirements as an original enactment when it comes to the need for fresh assent, provided that the repeal falls within the legislative competence of the State.

**Legislation** \- Legislature may, subject to constitutional limitations, repeal any law it has enacted \-If the Legislature has the power to enact a law on a particular subject, it equally possesses the power to repeal that law.

**Insurance Claim** \- NCDRC held that the insurance claim cannot be allowed in the absence of any valid permit \- Allowing appeal, SC observed: the permit which is on record and the National Permit is certainly valid up to 13.10.2017. The authorization fee was required to be paid only when the truck was moving out of State of Bihar as it was registered in the State of Bihar and the truck caught fire on account of short-circuit on 08.06.2014 in the State of Bihar itself and, therefore, the respondent company could not have repudiated the claim on such a frivolous ground. The permit in question was issued by the competent authority in Bihar and, therefore, there was no requirement of paying authorization fee when the truck was being used in the State of Bihar and as per the terms and conditions of the National Permit, authorization fee was required to be paid only when the truck was moving out of State of Bihar- The appellant was certainly entitled for the insurance claim.

Subsequent furnishing of the return of income by the assessee within the time limit prescribed under sub-section (4) of Section 139 or before prosecution is initiated does not have any bearing upon the fact that an offence under Section 276CC has been committed on the day immediately following the due date for furnishing return of income \-The point in time when the offence under Section 276CC could be said to be committed is the day immediately following the due date prescribed for filing of return of income under Section 139(1) of the Act, and the actual date of filing of the return of income at a belated stage would not affect in any manner the determination of the date on which the offence under Section 276CC of the Act was committed.

The latter part of the definition of the expression “first offence” is not to curtail the scope of the first half but to expand its ambit by including those cases where the assessee comes forward on his own initiative and discloses the commission of the offence- The restrictions laid down in Paragraph 8 of the guidelines are although required to be generally followed, the guidelines do not exclude the possibility that in a peculiar case where the facts and circumstances so require, the competent authority cannot make an exception and allow the compounding application.

**Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 \-** In criminal cases relating to domestic violence, the complaints and charges should be specific, as far as possible, as against each and every member of the family who are accused of such offences and sought to be prosecuted, as otherwise, it may amount to misuse of the stringent criminal process by indiscriminately dragging all the members of the family. There may be situations where some of the family members or relatives may turn a blind eye to the violence or harassment perpetrated to the victim, and may not extend any helping hand to the victim, which does not necessarily mean that they are also perpetrators of domestic violence, unless the circumstances clearly indicate their involvement and instigation. Hence, implicating all such relatives without making specific allegations and attributing offending acts to them and proceeding against them without prima facie evidence that they were complicit and had actively collaborated with the perpetrators of domestic violence, would amount to abuse of the process of law- Our observations, however, should not be generalised to mean that relatives cannot be brought under the purview of the aforesaid penal provisions when they have actively participated in inflicting cruelty on the daughter-in-law/victim. What needs to be assessed is whether such allegations are genuine with specific criminal role assigned to such members of the family or whether it is merely a spill over and side-effect of a matrimonial discord and allegations made by an emotionally disturbed person. Each and every case of domestic violence will thus depend on the peculiar facts obtaining in each case.

The mode and method of communication must be such that the object of the constitutional safeguard is achieved; c) When arrested accused alleges non-compliance with the requirements of Article 22(1), the burden will always be on the Investigating Officer/Agency to prove compliance with the requirements of Article 22(1); d) Non-compliance with Article 22(1) will be a violation of the fundamental rights of the accused guaranteed by the said Article. Moreover, it will amount to a violation of the right to personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. Therefore, non-compliance with the requirements of Article 22(1) vitiates the arrest of the accused. Hence, further orders passed by a criminal court of remand are also vitiated. Needless to add that it will not vitiate the investigation, charge sheet and trial. But, at the same time, filing of chargesheet will not validate a breach of constitutional mandate under Article 22(1); e) When an arrested person is produced before a Judicial Magistrate for remand, it is the duty of the Magistrate to ascertain whether compliance with Article 22(1) and other mandatory safeguards has been made; and f) When a violation of Article 22(1) is established, it is the duty of the court to forthwith order the release of the accused. That will be a ground to grant bail even if statutory restrictions on the grant of bail exist. The statutory restrictions do not affect the power of the court to grant bail when the violation of Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution is established.

(Para 21-22) C ourt should apply Section 106 of the Evidence Act in criminal cases with care and caution. The ordinary rule which applies to criminal trials and places the onus on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused, does not, in any way, stand modified by the provisions contained under Section 106 of the Evidence Act. The said provision cannot be invoked to make up the inability of the prosecution to produce the evidence of circumstances pointing to the guilt of the accused. The said provision cannot be used to support a conviction unless the prosecution has discharged the onus by proving all elements necessary to establish the offence.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 154-** If the informant dies, the First Information Report can be, unquestionably, used as a substantive evidence. A prerequisite condition must be fulfilled before the F.I.R. is taken as a substantive piece of evidence i.e. the death of the informant must have nexus with the F.I.R. filed or somehow having some link with any evidence regarding the F.I.R. (Para 32\) F.I.R. can be a dying declaration if the informant dies of his injuries after lodging the same (Para 33\) For an F.I.R. lodged by a deceased person to be treated as substantial, its contents must be proved. It has to be corroborated and proved for there to be any value of the same in the case. The F.I.R. can be used by the defence to impeach the credit of the person who lodged the F.I.R. under Section 154(3) of the Evidence Act. In case the death of the informant has no nexus with the complaint lodged i.e. he died a natural death and did not succumb to the injur- ies inflicted on him in relation to a matter, the contents of the F.I.R. would not be admissible in evidence. In such circumstances, the contents cannot be proved through the Investigating Officer. The Investigating Officer, in the course of his deposition, should not be permitted to depose the exact contents of the F.I.R. so as to make them admissible in evidence. All that is permissible in law is that the Investigating Of- ficer can, in his deposition, identify the signature of the first informant and that of his own on the First Information Report and he can depose about the factum of the F.I.R. being registered by him on a particular date on a particular police station.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 154-**. It may happen that the informant is the accused himself.

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order XXI Rule 32 \-** Imprisonment of a judgment-debtor is no doubt a drastic step and would prevent him from moving anywhere he likes, but once it is proved that he had wilfully and with impunity disobeyed an order of injunction, the court owes it to itself to make the judgment-debtor realise that it does not pay to defy a decree of a court. Failure to exercise this power in appropriate cases might verily undermine the respect for judicial institutions in the eyes of litigants. The court’s power under Order 21, Rule 32 is no more than a procedural aid to the harried decree-holder. Where the judgment-debtor disobeys a decree of injunction, he can be dealt with under this rule by his imprisonment or by attachment of his property or by both. But the court has to record a finding that the judgment-debtor wilfully disobeyed or failed to comply with the decree in spite of opportunity afforded to him. Absence of such finding is a serious infirmity vitiating the order. (Para 44-45) what is required of the person seeking execution of the decree for injunction under the sub- rule is to place materials before the executing Court as would enable it to conclude (i) that the person bound by the decree, was fully aware of the terms of the decree and its binding nature upon him; and (ii) that that person has had an opportunity of obeying such decree, but has wilfully, i.e., consciously and deliberately, disobeyed such decree, so that it can make an order of his detention as sought for. Thus, the onus of placing materials before the executing Court for enabling it to record a finding that the person against whom the order of detention is sought, has had an opportunity of obeying the decree for injunction, but has wilfully disobeyed it, lies on the person seeking such order of detention, lest the person seeking deprivation of the liberty of another cannot do so without fully satisfying the Court about its need. (Para 51\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order XXI Rule 32** Each breach of injunction is independent and actionable in law making the judgment-debtor answerable. Where there are successive breaches of decree, the judgment-debtor can be dealt with on every such breach and the doctrine of res judicata has no application. The court is expected to take strict view and stern action. (Para 46\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order XXI Rule 32** \- A decree of permanent injunction is executable with the aid of the provisions contained in Order XXI Rule 32 of the Code referred to above, and any act in violation or breach of decree of permanent injunction is a continuing disobedience entailing penal consequences. (Para 36\)

**Limitation Act \- Article 136** \- Enforcement or execution of a decree granting a perpetual injunction shall not be subject to any period of limitation \-The decree for permanent injunction can be enforced or becomes enforceable when the judgment debtor tries to disturb the peaceful possession of the decree holder or tries to dispossess the decree holder in some manner or the other or creates obstruction in the peaceful enjoyment of the property over which he has a declaration of title from the civil court in the form of a decree. (Para 41\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 227 \- Code of Civil Procedure 1908 Section 115 \- Jurisdictional Error \-** If an error, be it an error of fact or of law, is such that the erroneous decision has resulted in the subordinate Court or tribunal exercising jurisdiction, not vested in it by law, or in its having failed to exercise jurisdiction, vested in it by law, that will come within the scope of Section 115 of the Code or, for the matter of that, of Article 227 of the Constitution, as the case may be. This error may have resulted from a violation of rules of natural justice, by taking into consideration matters which are extraneous and irrelevant, or by substituting judicial consideration by bias, based on suspicion, arising from those extraneous matters or from any other cause whatsoever but if it has affected the assumption or exercise of jurisdiction, as envisaged above, it will be a jurisdictional error for purposes of the above Article. There is no exhaustive list of jurisdictional errors, but case law has identified such an error exists when a decision- maker has: identified a wrong issue; asked a wrong question; ignored relevant material; relied on irrelevant material; failed to observe a requirement of procedural fairness; made a decision involving fraud; made a decision in bad faith; made a decision without evidence; applied a policy inflexibly.

**Constitution of India \- Article 32,226 \-** Once the appointment process is declared to be a nullity in law, every action taken in furtherance of such appointment process is also illegal, and, therefore, the constitutional courts have jurisdiction to set aside such appointments wholly and ab-initio. This power of the Court is not curtailed even in a situation where a third-party right has been created in those who have been offered appointment or have even joined the service (Para 35\) a beneficiary of a back-door procedure cannot claim proper treatment as per law when they come at the receiving end. (Para 37\) If the subject appointments were ab-initio nullity in the eyes of law, it is not incumbent on the Court to pass the order after hearing all the parties that were likely to be affected by such decision, i.e., the candidates who were already appointed on the subject posts including the employee. (Para 32\)

**Public Employment \- Advertisements** \- Advertisements which fail to mention the number of posts available for selection are invalid and illegal due to lack of transparency \- A valid advertisement inviting applications for public employment must include the total number of seats, the ratio of reserved and unreserved seats, minimum qualification for the posts and procedural clarity with respect to the type and manner of selection stages, i.e., written, oral examination and interviews- that the State must specifically mention in the advertisement the total number of reserved and unreserved seats. However, if the State does not intend to provide reservation, in view of the quantifiable data indicating adequacy of representation, this aspect must also be specifically mentioned in the advertisement. (Para 22\)

**Constitution of India \- Articles 16(4) and (4-A)**  \- Though there is no fundamental right to claim reservation as Articles 16(4) and (4-A) of the Constitution of India are in the nature of enabling provisions only and do not mandate the State or its instrumentalities to provide reservation in every selection process but inspite thereof, the State’s decision to not provide reservation has to be based on some quantifiable data and valid reasoning. (Para 20\) 

**Constitution of India \- Articles 14,16 \-** Any appointment made in violation of the statutory rules as well as the mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution would be a nullity in law. (Para 23\) Arbitrariness in public employment goes to the very root of the fundamental right to equality. While no person can claim a fundamental right to appointment, it does not mean that the State can be allowed to act in an arbitrary or capricious manner. The State is accountable to the public at large as well as the Constitution of India, which guarantees equal and fair treatment to each person. Public employment process thus, must always be fair, transparent, impartial and within the bounds of the Constitution of India. Every citizen has a fundamental right to be treated fairly and impartially, which is an appendage of right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. A violation of this guarantee is liable to judicial scrutiny as well as criticism. (Para 39\)

**Constitution of India \-** The expression “lottery” takes its meaning from “betting and gambling”. Although a lottery ticket is nothing but an actionable claim, the conduct of a lottery scheme is nothing but a betting and gambling activity. Therefore, it is only Entry 62 – List II which enables the imposition of tax by the State Government. The activity of betting and gambling which includes conducting of a lottery is regulated under Entry 34 – List II, with Entry 62 – List II being the taxation entry. (Para 18.4)

**Constitution of India \- Article 32,226, 248** \- If a Central Act is challenged as being beyond the legislative competence of Parliament, it is enough to enquire if it is a law with respect to matters or taxes enumerated in List II. If it is not, no further question arises. Thus, the wide words of a substantive Article like Article 248 should be given full effect and they cannot be cut down by the wording in the Lists in Schedule VII merely because certain known taxes have not been included therein (Para 11.8)

**Contract Law \- Agency** \- The mere fact that a person does something in order to benefit another and the latter is relying on the former to do so or may have requested or even contracted for performance of the action, does not make the former the agent of the latter. The centrality to agency is the conferral of authority to alter legal relations; as such in common law, being an agent is not a status but a description of a person, while and only so long as the person is exercising such authority. Thus, where one person (the principal), requests or authorises the other (agent), to act on his behalf and the other agrees to do so, the law recognises that such agent has power to affect the principal’s legal position by acts which, though performed by the agent, are to be treated in certain respects as if they were acts of the principal. It is common to regard control by the principal as a defining characteristic of agency. Thus, agency is termed as acting on behalf of the principal and subject to principal’s control. (Para 15.3) **Lotteries \-** There is no promotion of the business of the State which conducts lotteries as an agent. Consequently, there is no principal- agent relationship, rather it is one of principal to principal. (Para 17.5)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \- Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 307** \- Will the mere mention of Section 307 IPC in the criminal proceedings force the court to adopt a hands-off approach, when parties come forward with a settlement? Mere mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or the charge-sheet should not be the basis for adopting a hands-off approach. It has further held that it would be open for the court to examine as to whether incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or whether there is evidence to back it. (Para 9-12)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 320, 482 \-** Quashing of offence or criminal proceedings on the ground of settlement between an offender and victim is not the same thing as compounding of offence. (Para 6\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Order XXII Rule 1 \- Limitation Act 1963 \- Article 120,121** \-The total time-frame for filing an application for substitution and for setting aside abatement, as outlined in Articles 120 and 121 of the Limitation Act, is 150 (90 \+ 60\) days. The question of condonation of delay, through an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, arises only after this period and not on the 91st day when the suit/appeal abates- The proper sequence to be followed, therefore, is an application for substitution within 90 days of death and if not filed, to file an application for setting aside the abatement within 60 days and if that too is not filed, to file the requisite applications for substitution and setting aside the abatement with an accompanying application for condonation of delay in filing the latter application, i.e., the application for setting aside the abatement. Once the court is satisfied that sufficient cause prevented the plaintiff/appellant from applying for setting aside the abatement within the period of limitation and orders accordingly, comes the question of setting the abatement. That happens as a matter of course and following the order for substitution of the deceased defendant/respondent, the suit/appeal regains its earlier position and would proceed for a trial/hearing on merits. (Para 11 )

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908-Order XXII Rule 4 \-** The law not having expressly mandated that an application for substitution has to be filed by the plaintiff/appellant upon receiving intimation of death, requiring a formal application from the plaintiff only will serve no tangible purpose. (Para 19\) When an application praying for substitution had been made, then, even assuming that it does not have an explicit prayer for setting aside the abatement, such prayer could be read as inherent in the prayer for substitution in the interest of justice. (Para 23\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Order XXII Rule 10A** \- Rule 10A casts a duty upon a pleader appearing for a party to the suit to intimate the court about the death of such party. It further provides that once the court is informed by the pleader of a party that he is no more, the court “shall” notify the opposing party of the death. A straightforward interpretation of this rule would suggest that the court's obligation to issue notice to the other party is indeed mandatory. Nonetheless, this obligation may not arise in all circumstances. One notable exception could be when the information regarding the party's death is conveyed to the court in the presence of the opposing party's pleader or is documented by the court in the order sheet. In such cases, if the pleader of the concerned party (and consequently the party itself) has already been notified, issuing a further notice from the court would not serve any substantial purpose other than being an exercise by way of abundant caution. Therefore, in the aforementioned scenario, the absence of a notice from the court would not imply a failure to comply with Rule 10A, suggesting that it is not “always mandatory”. (Para 29\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 136** \- There is no bar for the Supreme Court to erase defective orders by setting them aside, even in the absence of any challenge thereto. (Para 21\)

### [**Canara Bank vs Ajithkumar G.K. 2025 INSC 184 \- Compassionate Appointment**](https://www.caseciter.com/canara-bank-vs-ajithkumar-g-k-2025-insc-185-compassionate-appointment-2/)

**Compassionate Appointment** \- The underlying idea behind compassionate appointment in death-in-harness cases appears to be that the premature and unexpected passing away of the employee, who was the only bread earner for the family, leaves the family members in such penurious condition that but for an appointment on compassionate ground, they may not survive. There cannot be a straitjacket formula applicable uniformly to all cases of employees dying-in-harness which would warrant appointment on compassionate grounds. Each case has its own peculiar features and is required to be dealt with bearing in mind the financial condition of the family. It is only in “hand-to-mouth” cases that a claim for compassionate appointment ought to be considered and granted, if at all other conditions are satisfied. Such “hand-to-mouth” cases would include cases where the family of the deceased is ‘below poverty line’ and struggling to pay basic expenses such as food, rent, utilities, etc., arising out of lack of any steady source of sustenance. This has to be distinguished from a mere fall in standard of life arising out of the death of the bread earner. (Para 29\)

**Compassionate appointment** \- Lapse of time could, however, be a major factor for denying compassionate appointment where the claim is lodged belatedly. A presumption is legitimately drawn in cases of claims lodged belatedly that the family of the deceased/incapacitated employee is not in immediate need of financial assistance. However, what would be a reasonable time would largely depend on the policy/scheme for compassionate appointment under consideration. If any time limit has been prescribed for making an application and the claimant applies within such period, lapse of time cannot be assigned as a ground for rejection. (Para 27\) Principles discussed: a) Appointment on compassionate ground, which is offered on humanitarian grounds, is an exception to the rule of equality in the matter of public employment b) Compassionate appointment cannot be made in the absence of rules or instructions c) Compassionate appointment is ordinarily offered in two contingencies carved out as exceptions to the general rule, viz. to meet the sudden crisis occurring in a family either on account of death or of medical invalidation of the breadwinner while in service d) The whole object of granting compassionate employment by an employer being intended to enable the family members of a deceased or an incapacitated employee to tide over the sudden financial crisis, appointments on compassionate ground should be made immediately to redeem the family in distress e) Since rules relating to compassionate appointment permit a side- door entry, the same have to be given strict interpretation f) Compassionate appointment is a concession and not a right and the criteria laid down in the Rules must be satisfied by all aspirants g) None can claim compassionate appointment by way of inheritance h) Appointment based solely on descent is inimical to our constitutional scheme, and being an exception, the scheme has to be strictly construed and confined only to the purpose it seeks to achieve i) None can claim compassionate appointment, on the occurrence of death/medical incapacitation of the concerned employee (the sole bread earner of the family), as if it were a vested right, and any appointment without considering the financial condition of the family of the deceased is legally impermissible j) An application for compassionate appointment has to be made immediately upon death/incapacitation and in any case within a reasonable period thereof or else a presumption could be drawn that the family of the deceased/incapacitated employee is not in immediate need of financial assistance. Such appointment not being a vested right, the right to apply cannot be exercised at any time in future and it cannot be offered whatever the lapse of time and after the crisis is over k) The object of compassionate employment is not to give a member of a family of the deceased employee a post much less a post for post held by the deceased. Offering compassionate employment as a matter of course irrespective of the financial condition of the family of the deceased and making compassionate appointments in posts above Class III and IV is legally impermissible l) Indigence of the dependents of the deceased employee is the first precondition to bring the case under the scheme of compassionate appointment. If the element of indigence and the need to provide immediate assistance for relief from financial destitution is taken away from compassionate appointment, it would turn out to be a reservation in favour of the dependents of the employee who died while in service which would directly be in conflict with the ideal of equality guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution m)The idea of compassionate appointment is not to provide for endless compassionn) Satisfaction that the family members have been facing financial distress and that an appointment on compassionate ground may assist them to tide over such distress is not enough; the dependent must fulfil the eligibility criteria for such appointment o) There cannot be reservation of a vacancy till such time as the applicant becomes a major after a number of years, unless there are some specific provisions p) Grant of family pension or payment of terminal benefits cannot be treated as substitute for providing employment assistance. Also, it is only in rare cases and that too if provided by the scheme for compassionate appointment and not otherwise, that a dependent who was a minor on the date of death/incapacitation, can be considered for appointment upon attaining majority q) An appointment on compassionate ground made many years after the death/incapacitation of the employee or without due consideration of the financial resources available to the dependent of the deceased/incapacitated employee would be directly in conflict with Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution r) Dependents if gainfully employed cannot be considered s) The retiral benefits received by the heirs of the deceased employee are to be taken into consideration to determine if the family of the deceased is left in penury. The court cannot dilute the criterion of penury to one of “not very well-to-do” t) Financial condition of the family of the deceased employee, allegedly in distress or penury, has to be evaluated or else the object of the scheme would stand defeated inasmuch as in such an eventuality, any and every dependent of an employee dying-in- harness would claim employment as if public employment is heritable u) The terminal benefits, investments, monthly family income including the family pension and income of family from other sources, viz. agricultural land were rightly taken into consideration by the authority to decide whether the family is living in penury. v) The benefits received by widow of deceased employee under Family Benefit Scheme assuring monthly payment cannot stand in her way for compassionate appointment. Family Benefit Scheme cannot be equated with benefits of compassionate appointment. w) The fixation of an income slab is, in fact, a measure which dilutes the element of arbitrariness. While, undoubtedly, the facts of each individual case have to be borne in mind in taking a decision, the fixation of an income slab subserves the purpose of bringing objectivity and uniformity in the process of decision making x) Courts cannot confer benediction impelled by sympathetic consideration y) Courts cannot allow compassionate appointment dehors the statutory regulations/instructions. Hardship of the candidate does not entitle him to appointment dehors such regulations/instructions z) An employer cannot be compelled to make an appointment on compassionate ground contrary to its policy. (Para 11\)

**Practice and Procedure \-**Power of an appellate court is circumscribed by laws. Unless a particular case in appeal is so exceptional in nature that the appellate court considers it imperative to exercise power akin to power conferred on appellate courts by Order XLI Rule 33, Civil Procedure Code, such power should normally not be exercised. (Para 36\)

**Precedents** \- Even an obiter dictum of Supreme Court could be binding on the high courts (Para 39\) \- So long the decision that is doubted is overruled, it continues to remain binding. (Para 47\)

**Practice and Procedure \-** The relief that the suitor is entitled in law could still be denied in equity on account of subsequent and intervening events, i.e., events between the date of commencement of the litigation and the date of the decision; however, such relief may not be denied solely on account of time lost in prosecuting proceedings in judicial or quasi-judicial forum for no fault of the suitor- It would, therefore, not be prudent or wise to reject a claim only because of the time taken by the court(s) to decide the issue before it.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 304B \-Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 113B \-** Section 304B of the I.P.C. presupposes several factors for its applicability, which are; (i) the death of a woman caused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under normal circumstances; (ii) such death having occurred within seven years from the date of the marriage; (iii) soon before her death, the woman having been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband and (iv) such cruelty or harassment being in connection with the demand of dowry.

Unless it is found that the findings are perverse and the only conclusion possible from the compelling evidence is of guilt; Appellate Courts will be slow to reverse an order of acquittal. (Para 5\)

**Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 \- Section 37 \-** Appellate Court is bound by constraints of Section 37 of the NDPS Act while considering the prayer for the grant of bail during the pendency of an appeal. However, if, in the facts of the case, an accused has undergone a substantial part of the substantive sentence and, considering the pendency of criminal appeals, his appeal is not likely to be heard before the accused undergoes the entire sentence, the Appellate Court can exercise the power of releasing the accused on bail pending the appeal. If the relief of bail is denied in such a factual situation only on the grounds of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, it will amount to the violation of the rights of the accused under Article 21 of the Constitution of India- If a case is made out for the grant of suspension of sentence and/or bail in deserving cases on merits, the Court is not powerless to grant relief of suspension of sentence and bail pending an appeal, even if an accused has not undergone half of the sentence. There cannot be a rule of thumb that a convict cannot be released on bail pending an appeal against conviction unless he has undergone half of substantive sentence- If the Courts start adopting a rigid approach, in a large number of cases, till the appeal reaches the stage of the final hearing, the accused would undergo the entire sentence. This will be a violation of the rights of the accused under Article 21 of the Constitution. Moreover, it will defeat the right of appeal- Clarified Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee representing Undertrial Prisoners vs. Union of India (1994) 6 SCC 731\. (Para 5-8)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 504** \- Senior’s admonition cannot be reasonably attributed to mean an ‘intentional insult with the intent to provoke’ within the means of Section 504, IPC, provided that the admonition relates to the matters incidental to the workplace covering discipline and the discharge of duties therein. (Para 28\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 504** \- Mere abuse, discourtesy, rudeness or insolence does not amount to an intentional insult within the meaning of Section 504, IPC. Furthermore, it would be immaterial that the person who has been insulted and provoked did not actually break the peace or commit any offence (Para 22\) \-if the accused does not intend to give provocation, the offence is not made out. An insult without an ‘intention to insult’ is not punishable under Section 504, IPC. Further, ‘intentional insult’ must be of such a degree that it has the potential to provoke a reasonable person to break the public peace or to commit any other offence. (Para 24)Upon reading the complaint as a whole, if the Magistrate comes to a conclusion, prima facie, that there has been an intentional insult made by the accused to the complainant so as to provoke the latter to break the public peace or to commit any other offence, then only the act complained of would fall within the ambit of Section 504, IPC. The law does not mandate that the complainant should verbatim reproduce each word or words capable of provoking him/her to commit breach of peace or any other offence. The background facts, circumstances, the occasion, the manner in which the offending words are used, the person to whom they are addressed, the time, the conduct of the person who has indulged in such actions are all relevant factors to be borne in mind while examining a complaint lodged for initiating proceedings under Section 504, IPC- whether the person provoked further commits an illegal act or not is immaterial to draw the conclusion of culpability under Section 504, IPC. The ‘intentional insult’ and provocation must be so proximate and close that the accused has either the intention or the knowledge that the intentional insult made by him is likely to cause the provoked person to break public peace or commit some other offence. However, what would be the nature of ‘intentional insult’ causing provocation, to draw culpability under Section 504, IPC would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The test to be applied to determine if the intentional insult made by the accused is sufficient to cause provocation is that of a reasonable person, i.e., if the insult is sufficient to provoke any reasonable person to break peace or commit any other offence, only then the accused will be liable for the offence under Section 504, IPC.

**Hindu Marriage Act, 1955,- Section 25 \-**A spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the 1955 Act. Whether such a relief of permanent alimony can be granted or not always depends on the facts of each case and the conduct of the parties. The grant of relief under Section 25 is always discretionary. (Para 28\)

**Hindu Marriage Act, 1955- Section 24 \-** Even if a court comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, pending the final disposal of the proceeding under the 1955 Act, the court is not precluded from granting maintenance pendente lite provided the conditions mentioned in Section 24 are satisfied. While deciding the prayer for interim relief under Section 24, the Court will always take into consideration the conduct of the party seeking the relief, as the grant of relief under Section 24 is always discretionary. (Para 28\)

**Hindu Marriage Act, 1955- Section 5,11** \- The following categories of marriages are void:a. If one or both the parties to the marriage have a spouse living at the time of marriage; b. The parties to the marriage are within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two and c. The parties are sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two. (Para 11\) These marriages become void at the inception. Therefore, such marriages are void ab initio. Such marriage does not exist at all in the eyes of the law. (Para 13\)

**Hindu Marriage Act, 1955- Section 25 \- Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 125** \- The remedy under Section 25 of the 1955 Act is completely different from the remedy under Section 125 of the CrPC. It confers rights on the spouses of the marriage declared as void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act to claim maintenance from the other spouse. The remedy is available to both husband and wife. The principles which apply to Section 125 of the CrPC cannot be applied to Section 25 of the 1955 Act. The relief under Section 125 of the CrPC can be granted to wife or child and not to husband- Section 125 of the CrPC operates altogether in a different field. It is a quick and efficacious remedy made available to a wife or a child to seek maintenance. The proceedings under Section 125 of the CrPC are of a summary nature. While deciding the applications under Section 125 of the CrPC, a summary procedure is required to be followed, and a detailed adjudication of the rights of the parties cannot be made. The same is the legal position as regards the corresponding remedy under Section 144 of the BNSS. (Para 21-22)

**Hindu Marriage Act, 1955- Section 24 \-**The conditions for applicability of Section 24 are: (i) There must be a proceeding under the 1955 Act pending and (ii) the court must come to a conclusion that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding. (Para 27\)

**Hindu Marriage Act, 1955- Section 23-** A decree in proceedings contemplated by Section 23 of the 1955 Act is a narrower concept. It can only be a decree granting one of the reliefs under Sections 9 to 13 of the 1955 Act \-The following are the decrees which may be passed under the 1955 Act: a. A decree under Section 9 of restitution of conjugal rights; b. A decree under Section 10 of judicial separation; c. A decree under Section 11 declaring a marriage as void; d. A decree under Section 12 of annulment of a marriage on the ground that it is voidable; and e. A decree of divorce under Sections 13 and 13B- The ‘decrees in proceedings’ will not include the decisions dismissing the petitions seeking reliefs under Sections 9 to 13\.

**Constitution of India \- Article 21 \-** Calling a woman an “illegitimate wife” or “faithful mistress” will amount to a violation of the fundamental rights of that woman under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

**Uttar Pradesh Gangsters & Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 \- Section 2(b) \-** Mere invocation of certain Sections of the IPC could not and would not preclude the Court from, in a manner of speaking, lifting the veil, to understand what actually lies beneath the material, which is sought to be made the basis for invoking the Act \- It would be plainly unwise to accord any unfettered discretion to the authorities concerned when it comes to invoking the Act. The more stringent or penal a provision, greater the emphasis and requirement for it to be strictly construed-Compliance and strict adherence mean that only an eyewash by making allegations with a view to set up grounds to justify resort to the Act would not suffice. Material(s) must be available to gauge the probability of commission of the alleged offence(s). Necessarily, this would have to be of a level higher than being merely presumptive. (Para 24-25) The Act can be invoked basis pending cases \- However, the case(s) against the person(s) qua whom the Act is to be invoked cannot be run-of-the-mill – it must be serious- The severity required the underlying case(s), we think, ought not to be judicially strait-jacketed as a lot would turn on the specific peculiarities of each case.

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 34 \-** The award of interest is a discretionary exercise steeped in equitable considerations \- The power to award interest ought to be exercised judiciously, aligning with equitable considerations and also ensuring neither undue enrichment nor unfair deprivation. Courts are duty-bound to assess the facts and circumstances of each case, applying the principles of fairness and justice. This discretion must reflect a balanced approach, grounded in reason, and guided by the overarching objective of equity. (Para 49-50)

**Contract Law** \- A commercial document ought not to be interpreted in a manner that arrives at a complete variance with what may originally have been the intention of the parties. (Para 47\) 

**Equity** \- Whosoever comes to the court claiming equity, must come with clean hands. The expression ‘clean hands’ connotes that the suitor or the defendant have not concealed material facts from the court and there is no attempt by them to secure illegitimate gains. Any contrary conduct must warrant turning down relief to such a party, owing to it not acting in good faith and beguiling the court with a view to secure undue gain. A court of law cannot be the abettor of inequity by siding with the party approaching it with unclean hands. This also brings to mind the oft-quoted legal maxim—he who seeks equity must do equity

**Commercial Disputes** \- In commercial disputes, the award of interest pendente lite or post- decree is typically granted as a matter of course. This is because such interest serves to compensate the aggrieved party for the time value of money that was due but withheld during the legal process. It reflects an established norm aimed at ensuring fairness and equity in commercial transactions. (Para 58\)

**Income Tax Act 1961 \- Section 271AAA** \- The expression ‘Undisclosed Income’ \-The fact that the assessee has surrendered some undisclosed income during the course of search or that the surrender is emerging out of the statements recorded during the course of search is not sufficient to fasten the levy of penalty. The onus is on the Assessing Officer to satisfy the condition precedent stipulated in the said Explanation, before the charge for levy of penalty is fastened on the assessee. 35\. Consequently, it is obligatory on the part of the Assessing Officer to demonstrate and prove that undisclosed income of the specified previous year was found during the course of search or as a result of the search. (Para 34\) the expression ‘found in the course of search’ is of a wide amplitude. It does not mean documents found in the assessee’s premises alone during the search. At times, search of an assessee leads to a search of another individual and/or further investigation/interrogation of third parties. All these steps and recoveries therein would fall within the expression ‘found in the course of search’. (Para 41\) Though under Section 271AAA(1) of the Act 1961, the Assessing Officer has the discretion to levy penalty, yet this discretionary power is not unfettered, unbridled and uncanalised. Discretion means sound discretion guided by law. It must be governed by rule, not by humour, it must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful. (Para 31\)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 145 \- Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 161 \-** The portion of the prior statement shown to the witness for contradicting the witness must be proved through the investigating officer. Unless the said portion of the prior statement used for contradiction is duly proved, it cannot be reproduced in the deposition of the witnesses. The correct procedure is that the Trial Judge should mark the portions of the prior statements used for contradicting the witness. The said portions can be put in bracket and marked as AA, BB, etc. The marked portions cannot form a part of the deposition unless the same are proved. (Para 11\)

**Circumstantial Evidence** \- When the prosecution case is based on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established. There must be a chain of circumstances so complete as not to leave any ground for any conclusion inconsistent with the innocence of the accused. (Para 10\)

**Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 \- Section 45 \-** The consideration of the two conditions mentioned in Section 45 is mandatory, and that while considering the bail application, the said rigours of Section 45 have to be reckoned by the court to uphold the objectives of the PMLA (Para 16)- Merely because the prosecution complaint had been filed and the cognizance was taken by the court that itself would not be the ground or consideration to release the accused on bail, when the mandatory requirements as contemplated in Section 45 have not been complied with. (Para 20\)

**Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002** \- The offence of money laundering is an independent offence regarding the process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime, which had been derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to or in relation to a schedule offence. Hence, involvement in any one of such process or activity connected with the Proceeds of Crime would constitute offence of money laundering. This offence otherwise has nothing to do with the criminal activity relating to a schedule offence, except the Proceeds of Crime derived or obtained as a result of that crime. (Para 19\)

**Chandra Mohan Jha University Act, 2009 \- Section 14(1) \-** The appointment of the Chancellor, made by the University, shall require mandatory approval by the Visitor failing which, such appointment would be non est in the eyes of law (Para 36)- For the appointment of the Chancellor of the CMJ University, the Sponsor is not the sole authority, and the Visitor also plays a pivotal role. The Visitor is not merely a titular head and the appointment of any person as Chancellor by the Sponsor would attain validity only upon the approval of the Visitor- If a statute provides for the approval of the higher Authority, the order cannot be given effect to unless it is approved and the same remains inconsequential and a dead letter in the eyes of law.

**Principle of functus officio** \- Rule-making power of the legislature cannot be curtailed or nullified by application of the concept of functus officio. The principle of functus officio normally applies to a judicial forum or a quasi-judicial authority and would have no application to the rule-making authority which is within the domain of the State Government by virtue of Article 245 of the Constitution of India. (Para 42-3)

**Administrative Law \-** Administrative actions and statutory rules that impact citizens’ rights are subject to judicial review, the notion that the State must provide a prior hearing to affected individuals during the exercise of its rule-making power is fundamentally flawed- If the State Government is compelled to afford an opportunity of hearing to every individual or entity likely to be affected by its administrative decision-making, it would effectively paralyze governance by imposing an undue procedural roadblock. This would place the State in a position where its rule-making authority would be severely constricted, defeating the very purpose of efficient policy implementation and undermining its ability to discharge its administrative duties.

Mistakes or errors, though avoidable, are committed inadvertently. They have varied consequences in law. As per Section 20 whereby both parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to matter of fact essential to an agreement, the agreement is void. The explanation to Section 20 says that an erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject matter of an agreement is not deemed to be a mistake as a matter of fact. This will not be a case covered by Section 20 of the Contract Act. (Para 5\)

**Industrial Dispute \- Back wages \-** If the employee pleads that he was not gainfully employed, he cannot possibly prove such negative fact by adducing positive evidence. In the absence of any contra-material on record, his version has to be accepted.- After the employee pleads his non-employment and if the employer asserts that the employee was gainfully employed between the dates of termination and proposed reinstatement, the onus of proof would shift to the employer to prove such assertion having regard to the cardinal principle that ‘he who asserts must prove’. Law, though, seems to be well settled that if the employer by reason of its illegal act deprives any of its employees from discharging his work and the termination is ultimately held to be bad in law, such employee has a legitimate and valid claim to be restored with all that he would have received but for being illegally kept away from work. This is based on the principle that although the employee was willing to perform work, it was the employer who did not accept work from him and, therefore, if the employer’s action is held to be illegal and bad, such employer cannot escape from suffering the consequences. However, it is elementary but requires to be restated that while grant of full back wages is the normal rule, an exceptional case with sufficient proof has to be set up by the employer to escape the burden of bearing back wages. (Para 44\)

**Legal Maxims \- Suggestio falsi and suppresio veri \-** suggestio falsi and suppresio veri embody concepts of unethical conduct of a party having serious consequences in various fields including law- suggestio falsi is a false representation or a misleading suggestion while suppresio veri connotes suppression of the truth; an indirect lie, whether by words, conduct, or artifice. It is a type of fraud. (Para 23\)

**Industrial Disputes \-** The law of evidence per se does not apply to industrial adjudication. Nevertheless, the general principles do apply. In any event, in industrial adjudication, principles of natural justice have to be complied with. Fairness in procedure has developed as the third limb of natural justice. (Para 28\) To be relevant, a piece of evidence relied on by a party must be shown to have some logical connection to the case and its admission would be necessary to prove or disprove a fact. Once the evidence is found to be relevant and is admitted arises the question of its probative value. Probative value, as is well-known, refers to the weight or persuasive power of the evidence. It is not always necessary that a piece of evidence found relevant to a case would still demand significant probative value. An assessment has to be made by the court as to how convincing or persuasive the evidence is and how effective it would be to prove or disprove a fact. (Para 27\)

**Code of Civil Procedure \- Section 114 and Order XLVII, CPC \-** The court can look into any document, having a bearing on the lis decided earlier, which was not on record because despite exercise of due diligence the same could not be produced by a party. It would invariably reduce to an examination as to whether the document has such intrinsic worth that if the same had been produced, the outcome could have been different. (Para 35\)

**Industrial Dispute \- Back wages \-** Ordering back wages to be paid to a dismissed employee \- upon his dismissal being set aside by a court of law – is not an automatic relief; grant of full or partial back wages has to be preceded by a minor fact-finding exercise by the industrial adjudicator/court seized of the proceedings. Such exercise would require the relevant industrial court or the jurisdictional high court or even this Court to ascertain whether in the interregnum, that is, between the dates of termination and proposed reinstatement, the employee has been gainfully employed. If the employee admits of any gainful employment and gives particulars of the employment together with details of the emoluments received, or, if the employee asserts by pleading that he was not gainfully employed but the employer pleads and proves otherwise to the satisfaction of the court, the quantum of back wages that ought to be awarded on reinstatement is really in the realm of discretion of the court. Such discretion would generally necessitate bearing in mind two circumstances : the first is, the employee, because of the order terminating his service, could not work for a certain period under the employer and secondly, for his bare survival, he might not have had any option but to take up alternative employment \- The courts are loath to award back wages for the period when no work has been performed by such an employee.

**Indian Evidence Act, 1872 \- Section 9** \-A test identification parade is not substantive evidence in a criminal prosecution but is only corroborative evidence. The purpose of holding a test identification parade during the stage of investigation is, firstly, to ensure that the investigating agency is proceeding in the right direction where the accused is unknown and, secondly, to serve as a corroborative piece of evidence when the witness identifies the accused during trial. The evidence of identification merely corroborates and strengthens the oral testimony in court which alone is the primary and substantive evidence as to identity \- Evidentiary value of the TIP discussed \- Referred to In Rameshwar Singh v. State of Jammu and Kashmir (1971) 2 SCC 715 \- if the witness who identified a person or an article in the TIP is not examined during trial, the TIP report which may be useful to corroborate or contradict him would lose its evidentiary value for the purposes of identification- Once the person who identifies the accused during the TIP is not produced as a witness during trial, the TIP is of no use to sustain an identification by some other witness. (Para 14\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 34 \- Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 \- Section 3(5) \-**Although Section 34 IPC deals with a criminal act which is joint and an intention which is common, it cannot be said that it completely ignores or eliminates the element of personal contribution of the individual offender in both these respects- On the other hand, it is a condition precedent of Section 34 IPC that the individual offender must have participated in the offence in both these respects. He must have done something, however slight, or conduct himself in some manner, however nebulous whether by doing an act or by omitting to do an act so as to indicate that he was a participant in the offence and a guilty associate in it. He must also be individually a party to an intention which he must share in common with others- He must be a sharer both in the ‘criminal act’ as well as in the ‘common intention’ which are the twin aspects of Section 34, IPC. \[Para 87-89\]

**Context**: In this case, High Court held the husband-appellant guilty as it found that he never bothered to take his wife to the hospital as he wanted to ensure that she does not survive \-Thus it held that the husband could be said to be guilty having shared common intention with his mother \- Allowing appeal, SC observed: When the mother-in-law poured kerosene on the deceased and set her on fire, it is possible that the husband out of sheer fright might have run away from his house after trying to extinguish fire by pouring water on the burning body of his wife. For applicability of Section 106 so as to implicate the husband also in the alleged crime the prosecution has to lay the foundational facts first prima facie indicating his involvement or participation in the alleged crime. His sudden disappearance after the incident is not sufficient to infer common intention.

**Constitution of India \- Article 21 \- Speedy Trial \-**Howsoever serious a crime may be the accused has a fundamental right of speedy trial as enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution. (Para 11\) If an accused is to get a final verdict after incarceration of six to seven years in jail as an undertrial prisoner, then, definitely, it could be said that his right to have a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution has been infringed. The stress of long trials on accused persons – who remain innocent until proven guilty – can also be significant. Accused persons are not financially compensated for what might be a lengthy period of pre- trial incarceration. They may also have lost a job or accommodation, experienced damage to personal relationships while incarcerated, and spent a considerable amount of money on legal fees. If an accused person is found not guilty, they have likely endured many months of being stigmatized and perhaps even ostracized in their community and will have to rebuild their lives with their own resources- Delays are bad for the accused and extremely bad for the victims, for Indian society and for the credibility of our justice system, which is valued. Judges are the masters of their Courtrooms and the Criminal Procedure Code provides many tools for the Judges to use in order to ensure that cases proceed efficiently. (Para 14-15)

**Criminal Trial \-**Where the number of witnesses is large, it is not necessary that everyone should be produced- It is expected of the Public Prosecutor to wisely exercise his discretion in so far as examination of the witnesses is concerned- The Special Judge should inquire with the Special Public Prosecutor why he intends to examine a particular witness if such witness is going to depose the very same thing that any other witness might have deposed earlier.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 311 : Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 348** \- principles as governing the application of Section 311 Cr.P.C. : (a) The Section is divided into two parts, the first being directory with the use of the word ‘may’ and the latter being mandatory with the use of the word ‘shall’. (b) The power of the Court is couched in the widest terms possible with no express limitation thereon. (c) The exercise of such power is not only the prerogative but also the duty of the Court, in connection with a witness who may be considered absolutely necessary, in the interest of justice. (d) This power is to be used both for the benefit of the prosecution and the defence. To summon a witness because it serves the case of one of the parties and not the other, would be improper. (e) This power can be exercised at any stage of proceedings, i.e. enquiry, trial or any other. (f) Power is to be exercised judiciously since wider the power, greater the requirement of the application of a judicial mind. (g) If a witness so-called under this power, gives evidence against the complainant, the latter should be given an opportunity to cross- examination. This power arises not under Section 311 but under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872\. (h) A witness cannot be recalled by the use of this power to simply fill up a lacuna in the case of the prosecution.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 313 : Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 351-** Quoted from Raj Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi) (i) It is the duty of the Trial Court to put each material circumstance appearing in the evidence against the accused specifically, distinctively and separately. The material circumstance means the circumstance or the material on the basis of which the prosecution is seeking his conviction; (ii) The object of examination of the accused under Section 313 is to enable the accused to explain any circumstance appearing against him in the evidence; (iii) The Court must ordinarily eschew material circumstances not put to the accused from consideration while dealing with the case of the particular accused; (iv) The failure to put material circumstances to the accused amounts to a serious irregularity. It will vitiate the trial if it is shown to have prejudiced the accused; (v) If any irregularity in putting the material circumstance to the accused does not result in failure of justice, it becomes a curable defect. However, while deciding whether the defect can be cured, one of the considerations will be the passage of time from the date of the incident; (vi) In case such irregularity is curable, even the appellate court can question the accused on the material circumstance which is not put to him; (vii) In a given case, the case can be remanded to the Trial Court from the stage of recording the supplementary statement of the concerned accused under Section 313 of CrPC; and (viii) While deciding the question whether prejudice has been caused to the accused because of the omission, the delay in raising the contention is only one of the several factors to be considered. (Para 32\)

**Fair Trial** \- Article 21 guarantees the Right to Fair Trial.The following principles as to the meaning and import of fair trial, can be illustratively deduced : (1) Fair and Just investigation is the starting point of the fair trial process. (2) This process is a triangulation of the rights of the accused, the victim and the community that acts through the state and prosecuting agencies. (3) Process of investigation and trial must be completed with promptitude. (4) The trial Judge has to play an active role in the search for truth, which a trial, undoubtedly has to be. (5) Bias of all nature, against the accused, the victim, the witnesses; or the cause of/at trial, has to be eliminated. (6) The process of fair trial is to be done to maintain public confidence & uphold the majesty of law. (7) The atmosphere in which a trial is to be conducted in a fair manner has to be in an atmosphere of ‘judicial calm’. (8) Unfair prolongation of trial is an affront to the ideal of fair trial. (9) The ideal of fair trial has protection in the Constitution and in the international legal framework, as a basic human right. (10) The centripodal purpose of fair trial is to ensure that injustice is avoided as far as possible, but equally ‘fair trial’ is not leveraged to a point which would hinder the established procedure of Cr.P.C. In other words, the command of the Code cannot be ignored at the behest of the prosecution or defence, in the name of fair trial \- To secure a fair trial, is not a solitary responsibility. The Judge; the investigator; the investigating agency; and the counsel for either side, each have their own responsibility. (Para 10.6)

**Criminal Trial** \- A trial is a fact-finding exercise wherein both parties, i.e., the prosecution and defence, after investigation by the competent authorities, present their versions of events and the role and duty of the Court to determine the truth. While undertaking such determination, the Court is not only to look at the evidence at hand but also ensure that all consideration balances the demand for justice and the rights of the accused. (Para 7\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973** \- **Section 386** : **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 427** \-A Court in first appellate jurisdiction, has to appreciate the evidence on record, after duly summoning the record of the Courts below, and then arrive at its own finding, irrespective of the order under challenge before it being of conviction or acquittal- When particularly concerned with cases of Capital Punishment, naturally, since a person’s life hangs in the balance, the High Court’s responsibility is accordingly enhanced/heightened. It “must carefully examine all relevant and material circumstances before upholding the conviction and confirming the sentence of death.". (Para 18-19)

**Public Prosecutor \-** The job of the prosecution is to drive home the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, but at the same time, the prosecutor cannot forget that his first and foremost duty is, that of an officer of the Court. The prosecuting agency carries the role, primarily, till the time the matter enters the Court. They have a responsibility to examine all possible angles, collect all relevant evidence and then produce the same before the Court for determination of guilt or lack thereof.

(Para 26\)

**International Law \-** The Indian Constitution enjoins a responsibility upon all persons to foster respect for international law- Even when it comes to the gravest and most heinous crimes committed against humanity as a whole, a person accused of having so committed such offences is also entitled to basic protection under the law. In our facts, ending someone’s life is, in fact, one of the gravest crimes that a person may commit, and so even here the accused is entitled to the protection of law ensuring that the process that condemns him as ‘convicted of an offence’, is free of procedural irregularities and blemishes which may call into question the credibility of the conclusion arrived at by such a process- All prosecutions and conclusions of either guilt or innocence must give due importance and primacy to these obligations along with constitutional and statutory guarantees as discussed supra.

Consequently, in the absence of any averment, no issue was raised and no evidence was let in on that aspect of the matter. But, in the absence of such a plea or evidence on the issue of limitation, the High Court could not have set aside the order of the District Court.

**Prevention of Corruption Act 1988-** The preliminary inquiry is not mandatory in every case under the PC Act. If a superior officer is in seisin of a source information report which is both detailed and well-reasoned and such that any reasonable person would be of the view that it prima facie discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, the preliminary inquiry may be avoided. (Para 51\) \- The purpose of a preliminary inquiry is not to verify the veracity of the information received, but merely to ascertain whether the said information reveals the commission of a cognizable offence. The scope of such inquiry is naturally narrow and limited to prevent unnecessary harassment while simultaneously ensuring that genuine allegations of a cognizable offence are not stifled arbitrarily. Thus, the determination, whether a preliminary inquiry is necessary or not will vary according to the facts and circumstances of each case (Para 24). Referred to [Lalita Kumari v. State of U.P](https://digiscr.sci.gov.in/admin/judgement_file/judgement_pdf/2013/volume%2014/Part%20I/Lalita%20Kumari%20%20vs%20%20Govt%20Of%20Up%20And%20Ors1701939902.pdf?ref=caseciter.com). (2014) 2 SCC 1 \[**Context**: SC set aside HC judgment which had quashed FIR in a corruption case on the ground that no preliminary inquiry was conducted.\]

**Prevention of Corruption Act 1988- Section 17-** **Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 154 : BNSS \- Section 173 \-** PC Act only outlines the procedure for investigation of offences, therefore, as a necessary corollary, Sections 154 (corresponding Section 173 of the BNSS) will be applicable for the registration of FIR in relation to offences punishable under the PC Act \- Superintendent of Police is competent to direct the registration of an FIR if he has information about the commission of a cognizable offence, punishable under the PC Act. The former is also competent to simultaneously direct the Deputy Superintendent of Police to register an FIR for the offences under the PC Act, with the understanding that the subsequent investigation will be subject to the restrictions outlined in Section 17 of the PC Act. A composite order to register the FIR and conduct investigation aligns with the statutory framework of the CrPC and the PC Act. (Para 51\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 36, 154 : BNSS \- Section 30, 173** \- If the officer in charge of a police station can direct the registration of an FIR under Section 154, as a natural corollary by virtue of Section 36 CrPC, superior officers, are equally competent to issue such directions for registration of the FIR. (Para 44\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 154 : BNSS \- Section 173** \- If the information reveals the commission of a cognizable offence, the police officials are duty-bound to register an FIR, except in cases where individual reputation and relations are at stake, wherein it is advisable to conduct a preliminary inquiry. (para 28\)

**Fair Investigation** \-The purpose of fair investigation is to ensure that the accused is afforded all the rights guaranteed to him under the law. As a corollary, an investigation which should be expected to be fair, must focus on collecting evidence that leads to the right conclusion and nothing else. A fair investigation cannot be interpreted to cater to the accused only, rather it must be such that the entire investigation process has a backing of the law, and the due procedure established therein. Thus, the ambit of fair investigation tethers the procedural safeguards in order to remain immune from arbitrary actions of individual investigators. (Para 42\)

**Interpretation of Statues \-** Special law overrides the general law. However, when a general law and a special law address the same subject matter, the rule of harmonious construction is to be applied. (Para 35\)

**Limitation Act 1961 \- Section 5** \- High Court allowed application seeking condonation of delay of 2,422 days in filing an application under Order XLI Rule 19 CPC \- Allowing appeal, SC observed: High Court recorded no reason for condoning huge delay in filing application for restoration of the appeal, which was dismissed for non- prosecution and failure to deposit requisite court fee.

**Punjab VAT Act \-** P\&H High Court held that on the date of introduction of sub-rule (8) in Rule 21 of the Punjab VAT Rules, the State did not possess any power traceable to the Punjab VAT Act to confine the rate of input tax credit to the reduced rate of tax on the stock in trade i.e. on those concluded transactions where the taxable person had already earned input tax credit at the previous higher rate of tax \- Dismissing appeal, SC observed: the interpretation given by the High Court to the applicability of Rule 21(8) of the Punjab VAT Rules read with the amended first proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Punjab VAT Act is legally sound and warrants no interference.

**Input tax credit \-** The benefit of input tax credit is traceable to the statute. If the same has to be reduced, which will have an adverse civil consequence upon the beneficiary, it must have the requisite statutory sanction. (Para 41.1)

There is no promise offered by the State or the Government by reason of the invalid order issued by the Department \- When the officers of the government acts outside the scope of authority, the plea of promissory estoppel would not be available, especially since the doctrine of ultra vires comes into operation and the government cannot be held bound by the unauthorised actions of its officers.

**Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 \- Section 4(6)(b)(ii) \-** No conviction in a criminal proceeding is necessitated, if the misconduct alleged & proved constitutes an offence involving moral turpitude **\-** The failure of the employer to initiate a criminal proceeding on the fraud employed by way of the the fabricated/forged certificate produced for the purpose of employment, does not militate against the forfeiture- The only requirement is for the Disciplinary Authority or the Appointing Authority to decide as to whether the misconduct could, in normal circumstances, constitute an offence involving moral turpitude, with a further discretion conferred on the authority forfeiting gratuity, to decide whether the forfeiture should be of the whole or only a part of the gratuity payable, which would depend on the gravity of the misconduct. Necessarily, there should be a notice issued to the terminated employee, who should be allowed to represent both on the question of the nature of the misconduct; whether it constitutes an offence involving moral turpitude, and the extent to which such forfeiture can be made. (Para 10-13) \[Disagreed with view taken in Union Bank of India vs. C.G. Ajay Babu (2018) 9 SCC 529, but did not refer the matter to larger bench as it noticed that the statutory provision does not make it a requirement that the misconduct alleged & proved in a departmental enquiry should not only constitute an offence involving moral turpitude, but also should be duly established in a Court of Law \-The words "duly established in a Court of Law" cannot be supplied to the provision- It was observed that these observations were obiter dicta.\]

**Employee’s Compensation Act 1923 \- Section 4A(3) \-** The interest liability arises on default of the employer, in paying the admitted compensation due under the Act within one month from the date it fell due and if there is such default, necessarily interest shall run at the rate provided. That the interest runs from the date of the accident \-The interest statutorily provided is 12 % comes out from the provision itself. The discretion is only in so far as awarding a higher rate of interest; exceeding the prescribed lending rates applicable to scheduled banks. The discretion is only in so far as applying a higher rate, ensuring that it does not exceed the lending rate prescribed for scheduled banks. Hence 12 % simple interest per annum necessarily has to be applied. The legislative intent is very clear insofar as Sub­clause b) of Section 4A(3) conferring a discretion on the Commissioner/Authority to impose a penalty not exceeding 50 % of the amounts awarded while no such discretion is available under clause (a).

**Constitution of India \- Article 226** \-Ordinarily, Writ Court should not entertain any petition, seeking to challenge a show cause notice unless the Court is convinced that the same has been issued by an authority having no jurisdiction, or the same is tainted with mala fides. \[But in this case, SC partly quashed the show cause notice\]

**Blacklisting** \- There is always an inherent power in the Authority to blacklist a contractor. But possessing such inherent power and exercising such power are two different situations and connotations. There may be a power but there should be reasonable ground to exercise such power- An order of blacklisting casts a slur on the party being blacklisted and is stigmatic. Given the nature of such an order and the import thereof, it would be unreasonable and arbitrary to visit every contractor who is in breach of his contractual obligations with such consequences. There have to be strong, independent and overwhelming materials to resort to this power given the drastic consequences that an order of blacklisting has on a contractor. The power to blacklist cannot be resorted to when the grounds for the same are only breach or violation of a term or condition of a particular contract and when legal redress is available to both parties. Else, for every breach or violation, though there are legal modes of redress and which compensate the party like the Corporation before us, it would resort to blacklisting and at times by abandoning or scuttling the pending legal proceedings. (Para 30-33) Quoted from [Blue Dreamz Advertising Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Kolkata Municipal Corp.](https://www.caseciter.com/blue-dreamz-advertising-pvt-ltd-vs-kolkata-municipal-corporation-2024-insc-589-blacklisting/): 1.In case there exists a genuine dispute between the parties based on the terms of the contract, blacklisting as a penalty cannot be imposed. 2\. The penalty of blacklisting may only be imposed when it is necessary to safeguard the public interest from irresponsible or dishonest contractors, and 3\. The Corporation being a statutory body, have a higher threshold to satisfy before passing such blacklisting order and therefore, the measures undertaken by it should be reasonable- When there are guiding principles explained by this Court as to when & in what circumstances a blacklisting order can be passed then, such principles should also be borne in mind by the Authority at the time of issuing a show cause notice.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 432 \- Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023- Section 473 \- (1)** Where there is a policy of the appropriate Government laying down guidelines for consideration of the grant of premature release under Section 432 of the CrPC or Section 473 of the BNSS, it is the obligation of the appropriate Government to consider cases of all convicts for grant of premature release as and when they become eligible for consideration in terms of the policy. In such a case, it is not necessary for the convict or his relatives to make a specific application for grant of permanent remission. When the jail manual or any other departmental instruction issued by the appropriate Government contains such policy guidelines, the aforesaid direction will apply.(Para 21\) **(2)** Appropriate Government has the power to incorporate suitable conditions in an order granting permanent remission. The conditions must be such that they are capable of being complied with. The conditions cannot be vague. The conditions cannot be oppressive. When a convict is released by granting relief of permanent remission, it is necessary to ensure that he is rehabilitated in society. It is necessary to consider the nature of the crime he committed. To fix terms and conditions, it is necessary to ascertain the motive for committing the crime for which he was punished. Even criminal background needs to be taken into consideration. Another concern that must be taken care of is public safety. Even the impact on society and the victims of the offence needs to be considered while determining the terms and conditions. In short, the conditions must be such that the same ensures that the criminal tendency of the convicts remains in check, they do not indulge in the commission of crimes, and they are rehabilitated in society. Their proper rehabilitation is most vital as it prevents them from going back to their criminal activities.a) Consideration of various factors which are mentioned by way of illustration is necessary before finalizing the terms and conditions; b) The conditions must aim at ensuring that the criminal tendencies, if any, of the convict remain in check and the convict rehabilitates himself in society; c) The conditions should not be so oppressive or stringent that the convict is not able to take advantage of the order granting permanent remission; and d) The conditions cannot be vague and should be capable of being performed. (Para 21,13) **(3)** Order granting or refusing the relief of permanent remission must contain brief reasons. The order containing reasons should be immediately communicated to the convict through the office of the concerned prison. The copies thereof should be forwarded to the Secretaries of the concerned District Legal Services Authorities. It is the duty of the prison authorities to inform the convict that he has the right to challenge the order of rejection of the prayer for the grant of remission.-An order granting permanent remission cannot be withdrawn or cancelled without giving an opportunity of being heard to the convict. An order of cancellation of permanent remission must contain brief reasons. (Para 21\)**(4)**When the Presiding officer's opinion is sought as per Sub- Sections (2) of Section 432 of the CrPC and Section 473 of the BNNS, the Presiding Officer must submit his opinion at the earliest considering the fact that the issue of liberty of the convict is involved. (Para 20\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 72,161 \-Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 433A : Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023- Section 475** The power of the President of India under Article 72 of the Constitution of India and the power of the Governor under Article 161 of the Constitution to grant pardon, commute the sentence, or remit the sentence remains unaffected by Section 433-A of the CrPC or Section 475 of the BNSS. (Para 3\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 432, 433A : Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023- Section 473, 475** The power under Section 432 of the CrPC is circumscribed by Section 433-A. It provides that where a sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed on conviction of a person for an offence for which death is one of the punishments provided or where a sentence of death imposed on a person has been commuted under Section 433 into one of imprisonment for life, the appropriate Government cannot grant remission unless the convict has served at least fourteen years of actual imprisonment. There is an identical provision in Section 475 of the BNSS. This is an embargo on the power of the appropriate Government under Section 432 of the CrPC. (Para 3\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 19(1)(a) \-** The right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) is paramount. At the same time, Those working in the media, particularly, individuals in key positions, authors, etc., must exercise utmost caution and responsibility before publishing any statements, news, or opinions. The power of the media in shaping public opinion is significant and the press possesses the ability to influence public sentiments and alter perceptions, with remarkable speed. Given its vast reach, a single article or report can resonate with millions, shaping their beliefs and judgments, and it has the capability to cause severe damage to the reputation of those concerned, with consequences that may be far-reaching and enduring. This highlights the critical need for accuracy and fairness in media reporting, especially when dealing with matters having the potential to impact the integrity of individuals or institutions. Keeping these aspects in mind, publication of the news articles must be done in public interest and with good faith- Quotes Bulwer Lytton:“The Pen is mightier than the sword”.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 200 \- Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 210** \- Upon receiving a private complaint under section 200 Cr.P.C., the Magistrate must mandatorily conduct an inquiry or investigation before proceeding to issue process against the accused, if such accused resides outside the jurisdiction of the Court. In other words, the Magistrate must examine witnesses before issuing summons in cases where the accused resides outside the Magistrate’s jurisdiction. (para 13.3)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 499 : Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 \- Section 356** \- Defamation under section 499 IPC necessitates both an intention to harm or knowledge that the imputation is likely to cause harm, and that the imputation must be capable of lowering the reputation of the person in the estimation of others. In other words, the essence of defamation lies not merely in the making of an imputation but in its effect on the perception of the public, thereby impacting the standing of the person in society. (Para 13.2)

**Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867-** The Act imposes a higher degree of responsibility and liability on an editor- Since an “editor” has been defined as the person who controls the selection of the matter that is published in a newspaper, the presumption goes to the extent of holding that he was the person, who controlled the selection of the matter that was published in the newspaper. However, merely because the Act does not mention persons holding other roles in a publication of the company, such as an Editorial Director, or mandate the publication of their names, the same does not imply that such persons cannot be made liable for any defamatory content. The key distinction is that unlike an editor, against whom a statutory presumption is imposed, there is no such presumption against the editorial director at the outset (Para 19.1)- Every newspaper must clearly mention the names of its owner and editor, ensuring transparency in publication. Furthermore, a statutory presumption is cast upon the editor, who is responsible for the selection of content that is subsequently published, making him accountable for the same unless proven otherwise.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 437(6)-** Reasons for rejection of application under sub-section (6) of the said Section have to be different and little more weighty than the reasons that may be relevant for rejection for bail at the initial stage (Para 11)- Applications under Section 437 (6) have to be given a liberal approach and it would be a sound and judicious exercise of discretion in favour of the accused by the Court concerned more particularly where there is no chance of tampering of evidence e.g. where the case depends on documentary evidence which is already collected; where there is no fault on part of the accused in causing of delay; where there are no chances of any abscondence by the accused; where there is little scope for conclusion of trial in near future; where the period for which accused has been in jail is substantial in comparison to the sentence prescribed for the offence for which he is tried. Normal parameters for deciding bail application would also be relevant while deciding application under Section 437(6) of the Code, but not with that rigour as they might have been at the time of application for regular bail- Where there is absence of positive factors going against the accused showing possibility of prejudice to prosecution or accused being responsible for delay in trial, application under Section 437(6) has to be dealt with liberal hands to protect individual liberty as envisaged under the Constitution of India and sought to be protected by insertion of sub-section (6) to Section 437 of the Code by the legislature.

**Equitable mortgage \-**Where under the law no mortgage or charge is said to have been created over a property i.e., no conveyance of a right or interest over the subject property has been effected, yet if the intention of parties to create a mortgage is clear, equity would demand that such intention is not only respected but given some effect to and the said property be deemed to have been mortgaged so as to enable the lender to assert its rights over the same, it is known as an ‘equitable mortgage’ \-**Distinction between a legal mortgage and an equitable mortgage under the English Law \-** In the former, there is conveyance or transfer of some proprietary interest in the mortgaged property in accordance with the statute or law whereas in the latter the formalities required for a legal mortgage are not fully satisfied, but the parties' intentions to create a mortgage are clear as result of which it is deemed as a mortgage.- Where a borrower willingly parts away with any title deed or a document or a promissory note or an undertaking in respect of a property by depositing it with the lender for the purpose of availing any credit facility and upon such deposit, the loan is so advanced by the lender, fairness, good conscience and justice or in other words ‘equity’ would demand that some meaningful significance be given to such act or conduct of the parties, as generally such act of depositing documents against loans is more often than not for no other purpose but to create a mortgage. Thus, a “court of conscience” would give effect to the intention of the parties in the form of an ‘equitable mortgage’ even if there is no formal agreement or a shred of document expressly providing that such deposit is for the purpose of creating a charge OR if the documents so deposited do not necessarily have the effect of transferring or conveyancing any title or interest in the subject property to the lender. (Para 35\) Equitable mortgage would be subservient to a legal mortgage \- The former does not create any de jure charge or right in the subject property and rather is only a right in personam \- Although the legal mortgage would have assumed priority in charge, yet an equitable mortgage may still be enforceable as secondary charge, provided the other considerations such as notice of such mortgage is fulfilled. (Para 53\)

**Transfer of Property Act 1882 \- Section 58,100-** ‘Equitable mortgages’ are very much recognized in India under the nomenclature of “charge” in terms of Section 100 of the Act, 1882, and the same will be enforceable as far as possible in terms of the procedure and provisions application to a simple mortgage except those without notice of such charge \- Any act of the parties that evinces a clear intention of the parties to create a mortgage though the same might not have been created in terms of Section 58 of the Act, 1882, may still be a valid charge in terms of Section 100 of the Act, 1882\. (Para 55-56)

**Transfer of Property Act 1882 \- Section 59,100-**Section 100 does not attract the provisions of Section 59 \-A charge may be made without any writing and there is no provision of law which require that such an instrument must be attested or registered. (Para 57\)

**Mortgage** \- Where a transaction does not amount to a mortgage but nevertheless can be construed as a preliminary step towards the preparation of a mortgage which will be security thereafter with nothing else done for conveyance or transfer of title or interest, there three recourses may be available to the lender: \- (i) He may simply claim that the transaction amounts to an equitable mortgage as it was for the purpose of creating a present or immediate security which a court of equity ought to consider; or (ii) He may claim that there has been a sufficient part performance of the contract, with attending circumstances which a court ought to relieve by permitting the lender to ‘perfect its mortgage’ i.e., to take further steps for the transfer of conveyance of title or interest in order to create a mortgage; or (iii) He may bring a suit for recovery of money and base his claim simply on the ab initio intention of the parties to create a security in the first place and the resultant part-performance of the contract insofar as the loan was extended based on such promise or consideration of security. (Para 61\)

**Transfer of Property Act 1882 \- Section 58(f)-** A mortgage by deposit of title deeds is for all purposes a ‘legal mortgage’ and not an equitable mortgage- Deposit of title deeds is one of the many forms of mortgages whereunder there is a transfer of interest in specific immovable property for the purpose of securing payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way of loan. The three requisites for a valid mortgage are, (i) debt; (ii) deposit of title deed; and (iii) an intention that the deed shall operate as security for the debt. In other words, when the debtor deposits with the creditor title deeds of his property with an intent to create a security, the law implies a contract between the parties to create a mortgage and no registered instrument is required under Section 59 of the Act, 1882 as in other classes of mortgage. It is essential to bear in mind that the essence of a mortgage by deposit of title deeds is the actual handing over by a borrower to the lender of documents of title to immovable property with the intention that those documents shall constitute a security which will enable the creditor ultimately to recover the money which he has lent. Whether there is an intention that the deed shall be security for the debt is a question of fact to be decided in each case on its own merits.

**Advocates Act 1961- Section 16 \-** An advocate can be designated as a senior advocate if:- a) He consents to such designation; and b) The Supreme Court or a High Court is of the opinion that by virtue of his ability, standing at the Bar, or special knowledge or experience in law, he is deserving of such distinction \- This provision does not contemplate any application being made by any advocate for seeking designation as a senior advocate. (Para 31-32)

**Senior Advocate Designation process \- Both decisions In Indira Jaisingh’s Case needs Reconsideration**\- Whether the Court should permit applications to be made for grant of designation, though the statute does not contemplate that. If the legislature intended to allow advocates to make applications for designation, sub-section (2) of Section 16 would not have provided for this Court or High Courts to take the consent of advocates before designation- **Experience** \- Mere experience in terms of number of years of practice is not sufficient. Our concern is whether 10 or 20 points should be mechanically assigned only based on experience or the number of years of practice. It is worth considering whether only the number of years put in practice has any nexus with ‘standing’ within the meaning of Section 16(2) \-**Interview \-** If an advocate, by virtue of his standing at the Bar, his ability or special knowledge, deserves designation as a senior advocate, the question which arises is, by making such an advocate appear for an interview, are we not compromising on the dignity of the advocate? Are we not converting the process of designation into a selection process? whether by interviewing a candidate for a few minutes, his personality or suitability can be really tested- **Secret Ballot \-** The issue of permitting voting by secret ballot needs serious reconsideration- whether the Judges should openly discuss the merits and demerits of those who appear before them on the judicial side \- **Trial Court lawyers** \- Whether the guidelines give sufficient opportunity to the advocates practising in our Trial Courts to get designated- designation under sub-section (2) of Section 16 cannot be the monopoly of the advocates practising in higher Constitutional Courts like this Court and the High Courts.-Registrar (Judicial) directed to place a copy of this judgment before Chief Justice of India to consider whether the issues flagged deserve to be considered by a Bench of appropriate strength. (Para 43,45)

**Supreme Court Rules 2013 \-** **Advocates on Record \-** (i)When a petition/appeal is not drafted by the advocate- on-record, the advocate-on-record who files it is entirely and wholly responsible to this Court. Therefore, when an advocate-on-record receives a draft of a petition appeal/counter-affidavit from any other advocate, it is his duty to go through the case papers and, thereafter, to carefully go through the petition/appeal/counter-affidavit to ascertain whether correct facts have been stated in the draft and whether all relevant documents are annexed to the petition/appeal/counter-affidavit. After reading the case papers, if he has any doubt, he must get the doubt clarified either by contacting the client or his local advocate. He is responsible for ensuring that he gets correct factual instructions so that there is no suppression of facts while filing petitions/appeals/counter-affidavits. An advocate-on- record is answerable to this Court since he has a unique position under the 2013 Rules. Therefore, when incorrect facts are stated in the petition/appeal/counter-affidavit or when material facts or documents are suppressed, the advocate-on- record cannot shift the entire blame on either the client or his instructing advocates. Therefore, it is his duty to be cautious and careful. His duty is to file proper proceedings and affidavits before this Court to assist the court in dispensing justice. He must always be fair to the Court and effectively assist the Court in deciding cases. The duty of the advocate-on-record does not end after filing a case or a counter. Even if the counsel appointed by him is not present, he must be ready with the case on law and facts and effectively assist the Court; (ii) It is the obligation of the advocates on record not to merely lend their names to petitions/appeals drafted by somebody else. If they do that, the very purpose of making a provision for setting up the institution of advocates-on-record will be frustrated. (iii) If advocates-on-record start behaving irresponsibly and start merely lending their names while filing petitions/appeals/counter-affidavits, it may directly impact the quality of justice rendered by this Court. Therefore, if any advocate-on-record commits misconduct or is guilty of conduct unbecoming of an advocate-on-record, an action against him as per Rule 10 of Order IV is warranted. (Para 44\)

The accused’s failure to present evidence on his behalf may be treated by the court as confirming the presumptions that may arise therefrom, nonetheless, that presumption alone, taking recourse to Section 106, would not be sufficient to convict an accused. The prosecution has to discharge its burden to prove the other circumstances in the case based on circumstantial evidence, to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt by leading cogent and clinching evidence.

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 118 \- Principles on appreciation of evidence of Child witness:** (I) The Evidence Act does not prescribe any minimum age for a witness, and as such a child witness is a competent witness and his or her evidence and cannot be rejected outrightly. (II) As per Section 118 of the Evidence Act, before the evidence of the child witness is recorded, a preliminary examination must be conducted by the Trial Court to ascertain if the child-witness is capable of understanding sanctity of giving evidence and the import of the questions that are being put to him. (III) Before the evidence of the child witness is recorded, the Trial Court must record its opinion and satisfaction that the child witness understands the duty of speaking the truth and must clearly state why he is of such opinion. (IV) The questions put to the child in the course of the preliminary examination and the demeanour of the child and their ability to respond to questions coherently and rationally must be recorded by the Trial Court. The correctness of the opinion formed by the Trial Court as to why it is satisfied that the child witness was capable of giving evidence may be gone into by the appellate court by either scrutinizing the preliminary examination conducted by the Trial Court, or from the testimony of the child witness or the demeanour of the child during the deposition and cross-examination as recorded by the Trial Court. (V) The testimony of a child witness who is found to be competent to depose i.e., capable of understanding the questions put to it and able to give coherent and rational answers would be admissible in evidence. (VI) The Trial Court must also record the demeanour of the child witness during the course of its deposition and cross-examination and whether the evidence of such child witness is his voluntary expression and not borne out of the influence of others. (VII) There is no requirement or condition that the evidence of a child witness must be corroborated before it can be considered. A child witness who exhibits the demeanour of any other competent witness and whose evidence inspires confidence can be relied upon without any need for corroboration and can form the sole basis for conviction. If the evidence of the child explains the relevant events of the crime without improvements or embellishments, the same does not require any corroboration whatsoever. (VIII)Corroboration of the evidence of the child witness may be insisted upon by the courts as measure of caution and prudence where the evidence of the child is found to be either tutored or riddled with material discrepancies or contradictions. There is no hard and fast rule when such corroboration would be desirous or required, and would depend upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case. (IX) Child witnesses are considered as dangerous witnesses as they are pliable and liable to be influenced easily, shaped and moulded and as such the courts must rule out the possibility of tutoring. If the courts after a careful scrutiny, find that there is neither any tutoring nor any attempt to use the child witness for ulterior purposes by the prosecution, then the courts must rely on the confidence-inspiring testimony of such a witness in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the absence of any allegations by the accused in this regard, an inference as to whether the child has been tutored or not, can be drawn from the contents of his deposition. (X) The evidence of a child witness is considered tutored if their testimony is shaped or influenced at the instance of someone else or is otherwise fabricated. Where there has been any tutoring of a witness, the same may possibly produce two broad effects in their testimony; (i) improvisation or (ii) fabrication. (i) Improvisation in testimony whereby facts have been altered or new details are added inconsistent with the version of events not previously stated must be eradicated by first confronting the witness with that part of its previous statement that omits or contradicts the improvisation by bringing it to its notice and giving the witness an opportunity to either admit or deny the omission or contradiction. If such omission or contradiction is admitted there is no further need to prove the contradiction. If the witness denies the omission or contradiction the same has to be proved in the deposition of the investigating officer by proving that part of police statement of the witness in question. Only thereafter, may the improvisation be discarded from evidence or such omission or contradiction be relied upon as evidence in terms of Section 11 of Evidence Act. (ii) Whereas the evidence of a child witness which is alleged to be doctored or tutored in toto, then such evidence may be discarded as unreliable only if the presence of the following two factors have to be established being as under: \- ▪ Opportunity of Tutoring of the Child Witness in question whereby certain foundational facts suggesting or demonstrating the probability that a part of the testimony of the witness might have been tutored have to be established. This may be done either by showing that there was a delay in recording the statement of such witness or that the presence of such witness was doubtful, or by imputing any motive on the part of such witness to depose falsely, or the susceptibility of such witness in falling prey to tutoring. However, a mere bald assertion that there is a possibility of the witness in question being tutored is not sufficient. ▪ Reasonable likelihood of tutoring wherein the foundational facts suggesting a possibility of tutoring as established have to be further proven or cogently substantiated. This may be done by leading evidence to prove a strong and palpable motive to depose falsely, or by establishing that the delay in recording the statement is not only unexplained but indicative and suggestive of some unfair practice or by proving that the witness fell prey to tutoring and was influenced by someone else either by cross-examining such witness at length that leads to either material discrepancies or contradictions, or exposes a doubtful demeanour of such witness rife with sterile repetition and confidence lacking testimony, or through such degree of incompatibility of the version of the witness with the other material on record and attending circumstances that negates their presence as unnatural. (XI) Merely because a child witness is found to be repeating certain parts of what somebody asked her to say is no reason to discard her testimony as tutored, if it is found that what is in substance being deposed by the child witness is something that he or she had actually witnessed. A child witness who has withstood his or her cross-examination at length and able to describe the scenario implicating the accused in detail as the author of crime, then minor discrepancies or parts of coached deposition that have crept in will not by itself affect the credibility of such child witness. (XII) Part of the statement of a child witness, even if tutored, can be relied upon, if the tutored part can be separated from the untutored part, in case such remaining untutored or untainted part inspires confidence. The untutored part of the evidence of the child witness can be believed and taken into consideration or the purpose of corroboration as in the case of a hostile witness. (Para 58\)  
**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 106 \-** Principles of Law governing the Applicability of Section 106 of the Evidence Act- court should apply Section 106 of the Evidence Act in criminal cases with care and caution. It cannot be said that it has no application to criminal cases. The ordinary rule which applies to criminal trials in this country that the onus lies on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused is not in any way modified by the provisions contained in Section 106 of the Evidence Act.Section 106 cannot be invoked to make up the inability of the prosecution to produce evidence of circumstances pointing to the guilt of the accused. This section cannot be used to support a conviction unless the prosecution has discharged the onus by proving all the elements necessary to establish the offence. It does not absolve the prosecution from the duty of proving that a crime was committed even though it is a matter specifically within the knowledge of the accused and it does not throw the burden on the accused to show that no crime was committed. To infer the guilt of the accused from absence of reasonable explanation in a case where the other circumstances are not by themselves enough to call for his explanation is to relieve the prosecution of its legitimate burden. So, until a prima facie case is established by such evidence, the onus does not shift to the accused.Section 106 obviously refers to cases where the guilt of the accused is established on the evidence produced by the prosecution unless the accused is able to prove some other facts especially within his knowledge which would render the evidence of the prosecution nugatory. If in such a situation, the accused offers an explanation which may be reasonably true in the proved circumstances, the accused gets the benefit of reasonable doubt though he may not be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the truth of the explanation. But if the accused in such a case does not give any explanation at all or gives a false or unacceptable explanation, this by itself is a circumstance which may well turn the scale against him. Section 106 has no application to cases where the fact in question, having regard to its nature, is such as to be capable of being known not only to the accused but also to others, if they happened to be present when it took place. The intention underlying the act or conduct of any individual is seldom a matter which can be conclusively established; it is indeed only known to the person in whose mind the intention is conceived. Therefore, if the prosecution has established that the character and circumstance of an act suggest that it was done with a particular intention, then under illustration (a) to this section, it may be assumed that he had that intention, unless he proves the contrary. (Para 76-79)  
**Criminal Trial \-** Principles for appreciation of ocular evidence in a criminal case : a. While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief. b. If the Court before whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate court which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the Trial Court and unless there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details. c. When eye-witness is examined at length it is quite possible for him to make some discrepancies. But courts should bear in mind that it is only when discrepancies in the evidence of a witness are so incompatible with the credibility of his version that the court is justified in jettisoning his evidence. d. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. e. Too serious a view to be adopted on mere variations falling in the narration of an incident (either as between the evidence of two witnesses or as between two statements of the same witness) is an unrealistic approach for judicial scrutiny. f. By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen. g. Ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb the details. h. The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image on one person's mind whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of another. i. By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation and reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They can only recall the main purport of the conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder. j. In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters. Again, it depends on the time-sense of individuals which varies from person to person. k. Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up when interrogated later on. l. A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court atmosphere and the piercing cross examination by counsel and out of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events, or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The subconscious mind of the witness sometimes so operates on account of the fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witness is giving a truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him. m. A former statement though seemingly inconsistent with the evidence need not necessarily be sufficient to amount to contradiction. Unless the former statement has the potency to discredit the later statement, even if the later statement is at variance with the former to some extent it would not be helpful to contradict that witness. n. The evidence of an interested and/or related witnesses should not be examined with a coloured vision simply because of their relationship with the deceased. Though it is not a rule of law, it is a rule of prudence that their evidence ought to be examined with greater care and caution to ensure that it does not suffer from any infirmity. The court must satisfy itself that the evidence of the interested witness has a ring of truth. Only if there are no contradictions and the testimony of the related/interested witness is found to be credible, consistent and reasonable, can it be relied upon even without any corroboration. At the end of the day, each case must be examined on its own facts. There cannot be any sweeping generalisation. (Para 56\)

**Criminal Trial \-** Though there can be no straight jacket formula for appreciation of circumstantial evidence, yet to convict an accused on the basis of circumstantial evidence, the Court must follow certain tests which are broadly as follows: \- (i) Circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established; (ii) Those circumstances must be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused and must be conclusive in nature; (iii) The circumstances, if taken cumulatively, should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else; and (iv) The circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence. In other words, the circumstances should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved. (Para 61\)

**Compensation** \- When a person is deprived of the use of his money to which he is legitimately entitled, he has a right to be compensated for the deprivation which may be called interest or compensation. Interest is paid for the deprivation of the use of money in general terms which has returned or compensation for the use or retention by a person of a sum of money belonging to other. (Para 17\)  
**Doctrine of Restitution** \- If on facts of a case, the doctrine of restitution is attracted, interest should follow. Restitution in its etymological sense means restoring to a party on the modification, variation or reversal of a decree or order what has been lost to him in execution of decree or order of the Court or in direct consequence of a decree or order. The term “restitution” is used in three senses, firstly, return or restoration of some specific thing to its rightful owner or status, secondly, the compensation for benefits derived from wrong done to another and, thirdly, compensation or reparation for the loss caused to another.

**Constitution of India \- Article 212 \-** The action of the Ethics Committee neither forms part of the ‘Proceedings of the Legislature’ nor is it tantamount to a ‘Legislative Decision’. (Para 23\) \[**Context**: Supreme Court on maintainability of writ petition filed by Dr. Sunil Kumar Singh, who was a Member of the Bihar Legislative Council (MLC) and Chief Whip of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), challenging his expulsion from the Council. Court directed that he be reinstated as a member of the BLC with immediate effect.\]  
**Constitution of India \- Article 32,226 \- Legislature** \- A few guiding principles for courts to consider while scrutinising the proportionality of actions taken by the House against its member(s). An indicative list of such parameters includes: (a) Degree of obstruction caused by the member in the proceedings of the House; (b) Whether the behaviour of the member has brought disrepute to the dignity of the entire House; (c) The previous conduct of the erring member; (d) The subsequent conduct of the erring member, such as expressing remorse, cooperation with the institutional scrutiny mechanism; (e) Availability of lesser restrictive measures to discipline the delinquent member; (f) Whether crude expressions uttered are deliberate and motivated or a mere outcome of language largely influenced by the local dialect; (g) Whether the measure adopted is suitable for furthering the desired purpose; and (h) Balancing the interest of society, particularly the electorates, with those of the erring members. (Para 64\)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 212 \-** The prohibition under Article 212(1) operates only with respect to the scrutiny of ‘Proceedings in the Legislature’ on the touchstone of ‘Irregularity of Procedure’. It does not oust the power of judicial review of the decisions of the Legislature, whether Legislative or Administrative, on the grounds of illegality or unconstitutionality. (Para 23\) **‘Proceedings in the Legislature’** comprise the formal steps, debates, and motions undertaken to facilitate deliberations within the House. It is a structured mechanism that ensures due consideration of a proposed measure, allowing for discussion, amendment, and scrutiny before reaching a final resolution. These procedural steps are not ends in themselves but are designed to channel legislative discourse towards a definitive outcome- A **‘Legislative Decision’** is the culmination of the legislative procedure—the formal expression of the will of the House on a given matter. While Proceedings of the Legislature provide the framework within which members exercise their deliberative functions, the Legislative Decision is the authoritative determination that follows such deliberation. These decisions of the Legislature, though emanating from a coordinate branch of Government, are not immune from scrutiny by Constitutional Courts. Judicial review of Legislative Decisions is not an encroachment upon legislative dominion but a necessary safeguard to uphold constitutional supremacy. (Para 13-14)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 142-** The extraordinary powers vested in this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, may be invoked in cases where remitting the matter would result in undue delay and where the interests of justice demand a swift resolution \- Court can transcend procedural limitations and provide equitable relief in cases where rigid adherence to legal provisions may result in injustice. When the established remedies fall short of addressing exceptional circumstances or fail to meet the demands of justice, this Court, as the final arbiter, must invoke its constitutional powers to bridge the gap and ensure a just, fair, and equitable resolution.(Para 84\)  
**Legal Maxims \-** ‘Expression unius est exclusion alterius' \-Whatever has not been included has, by implication, been excluded. (Para 15\)  
**Doctrine of proportionality \-** doctrine of proportionality is fundamentally embedded in the concept of fairness in action across domestic, foreign, and international legal systems. This principle ensures that measures taken are appropriate, necessary, and balanced in relation to the objectives they seek to achieve. Proportionality is deeply intertwined with the principles of the Rule of Law and natural justice, as it guards against arbitrary or excessive actions. Consequently, it is interpreted as an implicit requirement in almost every legal provision, unless it is explicitly barred by the legislation itself. (Para 54\)  
**Administrative Law \-** Distinction between legislative and administrative functions is well recognized in constitutional jurisprudence. When a legislative body frames rules under Article 208 and subsequently enforces them through disciplinary measures, such enforcement is an exercise of administrative power rather than legislative power. (Para 18\) if such an administrative decision is found to be arbitrary, mala fide, or in violation of constitutional rights, it is open to judicial intervention in the same manner as any other executive action of the State. Determining whether an impugned action or breach is an exempted irregularity or justiciable illegality is a matter of judicial interpretation and would undoubtedly fall within the ambit of Constitutional Courts. (para 20\)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 32, 226 \-** There is no absolute bar on the Constitutional Courts to examine the proportionality of the punishment imposed on a member while reviewing the validity of the action taken by the House. By focusing on the proportionality of punishment, courts must ensure that justice aligns with constitutional values and societal norms, thereby upholding the integrity of the democratic process.

Once an embargo has been put on a landowner not to use the land in a particular manner, the said restriction cannot be kept open-ended for indefinite period. The statute has provided a period of ten years to acquire the land under Section 126 of the Act. Additional one year is granted to the landowner to serve a notice for acquisition prior to the amendment by Maharashtra Act 42 of 2015\. Such timeline is sacrosanct and has to be adhered to by the State or by the authorities under the State. (Para 47-50)

In a case where the Court is satisfied that the facts are disputed by the State merely to create a ground for the rejection of the writ petition on the ground of disputed questions of fact, it is the duty of the writ court to reject such contention and to investigate the disputed facts and record its finding if the particular facts of the case, like the one at hand, was required in the interest of justice.

Although the word “may” has been used therein, yet the word “may” in both the sub-sections should be understood as “shall” because a Court is obliged to decide the consequences that the legislature intended to follow from the failure to implement the requirement. \[7\] The mere vesting of the land under sub-section (3) of Section 10 would not confer any right on the State Government to have de facto possession of the vacant land unless there has been a voluntary surrender of vacant land before 18th March 1999\. \[8\] The State has to establish by cogent evidence on record that there has been a voluntary surrender of vacant land or surrender and delivery of peaceful possession under sub-section (6) of Section 10 or forceful dispossession under sub-section (6) of Section 10\.

**Prevention of Corruption Act \- Section 20-**The presumption under Section 20 of the Act cannot arise on the mere allegation of a demand and acceptance of illegal gratification as rightly pointed out by the appellant- Unless proof is offered to the satisfaction of the Court that there is a demand and acceptance of illegal gratification, the presumption would not arise \- The presumption under Section 20 of the Act is that, if there is a demand and acceptance of bribe, then there is a presumption that it is to dishonestly carry out some activity by a public servant, for which, first, proof will have to be offered of the demand and acceptance. It is not otherwise that, if there is a misuse of authority then there is always a presumption of a demand and acceptance of bribe, resulting in a valid allegation of corruption. (Para 22\)  
**Prevention of Corruption Act \- Sections 7,13,20** \-The proof of demand (or an offer) and acceptance of illegal gratification by a public servant is a fact in issue in the criminal proceeding and is a sine qua non to establish the guilt of the accused public servant under Sections 7 and 13 of the Act.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 390, 397, 401 \-** The High Court has the power to suspend the operation of the order impugned in the revision application \- The power under Section 390 can be exercised in a revision against an order of discharge \- It is only in rare and exceptional cases where the order of discharge is ex-facie perverse that the revisional Court can take the extreme step of staying that order. However, such an order should be passed only after giving an opportunity of being heard to the accused. Moreover, while granting the stay, the Court must mould the relief so that the trial does not proceed against the discharged accused \- While exercising power under Section 390 of the CrPC, the normal rule is that the acquitted accused should not be committed to custody, and a direction should be issued to admit him to bail. This normal rule should apply all the more to cases where the challenge is to the order of discharge, as the order of discharge is on a higher pedestal than an order of acquittal- Passing an order under Section 390 directing the discharged accused to admit to bail is sufficient to procure the presence of the discharged accused at the time of hearing of the revision application and for undergoing trial if the order of discharge is set aside. (Para 14-20)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 390 \-** As a normal rule, where an order under Section 390 of the CrPC is passed, the accused must be admitted to bail rather than committing him to prison. It is well-settled in our jurisprudence that bail is the rule, and jail is the exception. This rule must be applied while exercising power under Section 390 of the CrPC, as the position of the acquitted accused is on a higher pedestal than an accused facing trial. When an accused faces trial, he is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty. In the case of an acquitted accused, as stated earlier, the presumption of innocence is further strengthened because of the order of acquittal. Only in extreme and rare cases by way of exception can an order committing an acquitted accused to prison be passed under Section 390\. (Para 18\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 227,245 \-** An order of discharge is passed when there is no sufficient material to proceed against the accused. When a discharge order is passed, the person discharged ceases to be an accused. The position of a discharged accused is on a higher pedestal than that of an accused who is acquitted after a full trial. The reason is that a charge can be framed, and an accused can be tried only when there is sufficient material in the charge sheet to proceed against him. An order of discharge is passed when the charge sheet does not contain sufficient material to proceed against the accused. Therefore, he is discharged at the threshold. After an accused is discharged under Section 227 of the CrPC, he is set at liberty as he ceases to be an accused. (Para 12\)

**Judiciary** \- A greater representation of women in the judiciary, would greatly improve the overall quality of judicial decision making and this impacts generally and also specifically in cases affecting women. \- It is not enough to find comfort solely in the growing number of female judicial officers if we are unable to secure for them a sensitive work environment and guidance \- While gender is not a rescue for poor performance, it is a critical consideration which must weigh for holistic decision-making at certain times and stages of a woman judicial officer. (Para 17\)  
**ACR \-** The imprimatur of the Chief Justice to an ACR is an approval of the highest judicial office in the State which is a mandatory requirement.(Para 15.8)  
**Service Law \- Probation \-** The services of a probationer could result either in a confirmation in the post or ended by way of termination simpliciter. However, if a probationer is terminated from service owing to a misconduct as a punishment, the termination would cause a stigma on him. If a probationer is unsuitable for a job and has been terminated then such a case is non-stigmatic as it is a termination simpliciter. Thus, the performance of a probationer has to be considered in order to ascertain whether it has been satisfactory or unsatisfactory. If the performance of a probationer has been unsatisfactory, he is liable to be terminated by the employer without conducting any inquiry. No right of hearing is also reserved with the probationer and hence, there would be no violation of principles of natural justice in such a case- (Para 12\) Even though a probationer has no right to hold a post, it would not imply that the mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution could be violated inasmuch as there cannot be any arbitrary or discriminatory discharge or an absence of application of mind in the matter of assessment of performance and consideration of relevant materials. Thus, in deciding whether, in a given case, a termination was by way of punishment or not, the courts have to look into the substance of the matter and not the form. (Para 12.3)

No evidence can suggest any cogent or unequivocal proof linking Appellant No. 2/Minor as the actual driver of the offending Vehicle at the time of the incident. Accordingly, in the absence of even the slightest credible evidence pointing towards the direct involvement of Appellant No. 2/Minor in the alleged act, the claim against him remains untenable and unsubstantiated.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 438 : BNSS 2023 \- Section 482** \- Anticipatory bail can be granted where custodial interrogation is not essential, particularly in cases where the allegations hinge on official records and the presence of the accused can be secured without pre- trial detention.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 : BNSS 2023 \- Section 528 \-** The scope of allowing a prayer for quashing is limited and is to be exercised only in exceptional cases where it is manifestly clear that no offense is made out \- At the stage of investigation, Courts should refrain from preemptively quashing criminal proceedings unless there is an evident abuse of process.

**Child Custody-** The principle of comity of courts and a pre-existing order of a Foreign Court must yield to the best interests of the child, especially when the Court has decided to conduct an elaborate enquiry in this regard- Such cases must be decided on the sole and predominant criterion of ‘what would serve the interests and welfare’ of the minor-The pre- existing order of a Foreign Court is merely one of the circumstances to consider when assessing the best interests and welfare of the person concerned-his doctrine was evolved to protect children who may, unwittingly, become collateral damage in their parents’ legal disputes. It has gained significance over the past several years, owing to the frequency and ease of migration. To consider the interests of the child, the Court must take into account all attending circumstances and the totality of the situation. The Court must consider the welfare and happiness of the child as the paramount consideration and go into all relevant aspects of welfare including stability and security, loving and understanding care and guidance, and full development of the child's character, personality, and talents \- The Court has to give due weightage to the child's ordinary contentment, health, education, intellectual development, favourable surroundings, and future prospects. Further, over and above physical comforts, moral and ethical values also have to be taken note of, as they constitute equal if not more important factors than the others. (Para 32\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 15 ; Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 \-** RPwD Act, 2016 has acquired the status equal to that of a ‘super-statute’ and hence, contains the ingredients of a quasi-constitutional law \- It is high time that an anti- discrimination clause be included in the Constitution with a specific provision that the State shall not discriminate on the grounds of mental or physical disability in line with the principles as stated in the RPwD Act, 2016\.

**Specific Relief Act 1963 \- Section 28** \- The non-payment of the balance sale consideration within the time period fixed by the Trial Court does not amount to abandonment of the contract and consequent rescinding of the same. The real test must be to see if the conduct of the plaintiff will amount to a positive refusal to complete his part of the contract. There must be an element of wilful negligence on the part of the plaintiff before a Court proceeds to invoke Section 28 of the Act and rescind the contract. (Para 49\) Merely because rescission of contract was not sought by the judgment debtor the same would not automatically result in extension of time. (Para 26\) If during the specified time period the decree holder is not in a position to deposit the balance sale consideration or, in other words, fails to deposit the balance sale consideration and later upon expiry of the specified time period seeks permission to deposit, then it would be within the discretion of the trial court to grant further time to deposit the balance sale consideration or decline- This discretion has to be exercised judiciously keeping in mind various factors like bona fide of the decree holder, the cause for failure to deposit the balance sale consideration in time, the length of delay and also the equities that might have been created during the interregnum period in favour of the judgment debtor. It is the cumulative effect and considerations of such factors that should weigh with the court concerned while permitting the decree holder to deposit the balance sale consideration beyond the time period that might have been prescribed by the trial court in its final decree.- Just because a decree of specific performance can be executed within 12 years from the date of original decree or from the date the appellate court affirms such decree that, by itself, does not mean that a decree holder deposits the balance sale consideration at his own sweet will. 52\. If the appellate court had failed to stipulate any particular time period then it is expected of the decree holder to deposit the same within a reasonable period of time. (Para 50-52)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order XX Rule 12A \-** Rule 12A makes it obligatory for the court to specify in the decree for specific performance of contract for sale or lease of immovable property the date by which purchase money or other sum should be paid by the vendee or lessee. The trial court has jurisdiction to fix time-limit for depositing the money by the decree- holder under Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963\. The decree is preliminary in nature and the court retains control over it. (Para 34\) **Appellate Courts owe a duty to comply with the provisions of Order XX Rule 12A** \-Where an appeal is filed against the decree passed by the trial court and the appeal is disposed of, the appellate court should specify time to deposit the balance sale consideration- It is too much to say that since the trial court had granted two months time to the decree holder to deposit the balance sale consideration the same time period would apply even to the decree that may be drawn by the appellate court. What is executable is the decree passed by the appellate court. The appellate court owes a duty to specify the time period.(Para 50\)  
**Doctrine of merger \-** Once the judgment passed by the trial court is challenged before the appellate court the judgment and order passed by the trial court would get merged with the judgment of the appellate court irrespective of the fact whether the appeal is allowed or dismissed- The doctrine of merger is founded on the rationale that there cannot be more than one operative decree at a given point of time. The doctrine of merger applies irrespective of whether the appellate court has affirmed, modified or reversed the decree of the trial court. (Para 36-37)  
**Summary**: The appellant filed a suit for specific performance based on a sale agreement \- The Trial Court decreed the suit directing the plaintiff to deposit the balance sale consideration (Rs. 6,86,875 minus Rs. 2,50,000 already paid) within two months \- The defendants appealed to the District Court, which dismissed the appeal on April 21, 2015, affirming the Trial Court's decree without specifying a new time limit for depositing the balance amount- In January 2017, the appellant filed an execution petition, seeking permission to deposit the balance sale consideration (Rs. 4,87,000). The Executing Court allowed this on May 6, 2019, and the amount was deposited on May 20, 2019- The Punjab and Haryana High Court, on August 30, 2022, overturned the Executing Court’s order, ruling the decree unexecutable due to the appellant’s delay (nearly three years after the appeal dismissal) in depositing the balance amount, absent compelling reasons- The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the High Court’s order, and upheld the Executing Court’s order.

**Constitution of India \- Article 21, 51A(e) \-Breast Feeding \-** The practice of breast- feeding in public places and at workplaces is not stigmatized- Breast-feeding is an integral component of a child’s right to life, survival, and development to the highest attainable standard of health. It is an integral part of a woman’s reproductive process and is essential for the health and well-being of both mother and the child \- As the right of a child to be breast-fed is inextricably linked with the mother, she also has the right to breast-feed her child- State has the obligation to ensure adequate facilities and environment to facilitate mothers to breast-feed their children. Such a right and the obligation emanate from Article 21 of the Constitution of India and the foundational principle of ‘the best interest of the child’ as enshrined in international law as well as the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015- **Directions issued:**Advisory for setting up of the facilities at public places is for the purpose of ensuring privacy and comfort of nursing mothers, who have infants, and for the benefit of infants- Directed Union of India to incorporate the aforesaid advisory in the form of a reminder communication to the Chief Secretary/Administrator of all State Governments/ Union Territories- in the existing public places as far as practicable, the States/Union Territories should ensure that the aforesaid directions are given effect to- Insofar as the public buildings which are at the stage of planning and construction, it may ensure that sufficient space is reserved for the purposes in the form of child- care/nursing rooms.

However, it does not amount to hurting the religious sentiments of the informant. (Para 19\)  
**Context**: According to FIR, The informant claimed that on 18th November 2020, while delivering information to the appellant’s residence as per official duty, the appellant refused to accept the documents initially, abused him by referencing his religion (calling him "Miyan-Tiyan" and "Pakistani"), and used criminal force to intimidate him- A charge sheet was filed under Sections 298 (wounding religious feelings), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), 353 (assault to deter a public servant), and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)-The appellant’s discharge application under Section 239 Cr.P.C. was dismissed \-High Court upheld this dismissal \- Supreme Court allowed his appeal and discharged him from criminal case.

**Factories Act 1948 \- Section 2(m),2(k)** \- The business of laundry involving cleaning and washing of clothes including dry cleaning would be squarely covered by the expression “manufacturing process" (Para 33\) \[**Context**: High Court quashed the JMFC’s order, holding that dry cleaning does not fall within the definition of "manufacturing process" under Section 2(k) of the Act, as it does not result in a "new marketable commodity" or a transformation of the article into a commercially distinct product- In appeal, Supreme Court set aside the High Court’s decision and held:” “Manufacturing process” has been defined to mean any process for washing or cleaning with a view to its use, sale, transport, delivery or disposal. The linen deposited with the launderer is, after washing and cleaning, delivered to the customer for use. The ingredients of the section are fully satisfied.\]  
**Interpretation of Statutes \-**Where the words of statute are clear, the plain meaning has to be given effect (Para 33\) \- Where a statute under consideration itself defines for the purposes of the said Act a certain phrase, a court of law is bound to apply the term as defined except in exceptional cases where the opening part of a definition, ‘anything repugnant in the subject or context’ applies.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 304B** \- **Bail** \- In dowry-death cases, courts must be mindful of the broader societal impact, given that the offence strikes at the very root of social justice and equality. Allowing alleged prime perpetrators of such heinous acts to remain on bail, where the evidence indicates they actively inflicted physical, as well as mental, torment, could undermine not only the fairness of the trial but also public confidence in the criminal justice system. (Para 12\) when a young bride dies under suspicious circumstances within barely two years of marriage, the judiciary must reflect heightened vigilance and seriousness. A superficial application of bail parameters not only undermines the gravity of the offence itself but also risks weakening public faith in the judiciary’s resolve to combat the menace of dowry deaths. It is this very perception of justice, both within and outside the courtroom, that courts must safeguard, lest we risk normalizing a crime that continues to claim numerous innocent lives.

**Summary**: The appellant, C. Kamalakkannan, challenged his conviction under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 468 (forgery for cheating), and 471 (using a forged document as genuine) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The case stemmed from a forged marksheet submitted by Kumari Amudha for MBBS admission, inflating her marks- The trial court convicted Kamalakkannan in 2016, sentencing him to time already served (22nd October to 16th November 1996\) and fines, which were later reduced by the appellate court in 2017\. The High Court upheld the conviction- The Supreme Court allowed the appeal citing following reasons: (1)The original postal cover, allegedly bearing Kamalakkannan’s handwriting, was not exhibited in evidence, and only a photostat copy was relied upon, which was insufficient as primary evidence. (2) The handwriting expert’s testimony and report (Exhibit A-31) lacked credibility because the expert did not clearly identify the examined postal cover as the one in question, and the reasoning behind the analysis was not adequately presented or corroborated.

**National Medical Commission (NMC) Guidelines for MBBS Admission**  \- In the guidelines “both hands intact, with intact sensations, sufficient strength and range of motion” are considered essential to be eligible for the medical course- This prescription of “both hands intact…” is completely antithetical to Article 41 of the Constitution; the principles enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the salutary provisions of the RPwD Act. It also indicates a classification which is overbroad and glorifies ‘ableism’ \- A prescription such as “both hands intact…” reeks of ableism and has no place in a statutory regulation. In fact, it has the effect of denuding the rights guaranteed under the Constitution and the RPwD Act and makes a mockery of the principle of reasonable accommodation- It propagates that persons with typical abilities and with faculties similar to what the majority may have or somehow superior- The “both hands intact…” prescription has no sanctity in law as it does not admit of a functional assessment of the individual candidate, a matter which is so fundamental in protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act 2016 \- Section 96** ; **Consumer Protection Act \- Section 27 \-** The penalties imposed by the NCDRC are regulatory in nature and do not constitute "debt" under the IBC- practices. The penalties under Section 27 of the CP Act are aimed at compelling compliance and cannot be equated with recovery of an outstanding debt \- The moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC does not extend to regulatory penalties imposed for non-compliance with consumer protection laws. (Para 35,40)  
**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act 2016 \- Section 14,96** \- Distinction between the moratorium applicable to a corporate debtor under Section 14 of the IBC and the interim moratorium applicable to individuals and personal guarantors under Section 96 of the IBC-The former is much broader in scope and stays all proceedings against the corporate debtor, including execution and enforcement actions. However, Section 96 of the IBC is more limited in its scope, staying only "legal actions or proceedings in respect of any debt." Unlike corporate insolvency proceedings, where the goal is a comprehensive resolution of the company’s liabilities, individual insolvency proceedings are designed primarily for restructuring personal debts and providing relief to the debtor. The legislative intent behind limiting the scope of the interim moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC must be respected, and a blanket stay on all regulatory penalties would result in defeating the objectives of consumer protection laws. (Para 30\)  
**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act 2016 \- Section 14,96** \- While civil proceedings are generally stayed under IBC provisions, criminal proceedings, including penalty enforcement, do not automatically fall within its ambit unless explicitly stated by law.

(Para 32\) **\- Circumstantial Evidence \-** In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must convince the Court that circumstances point towards the guilt of the accused alone and none else, as also lack of his innocence.

However, such reliance should be placed after ascertaining the quality of the dying declaration and considering the entire facts of a given case \- If a dying declaration is surrounded by doubt or there are inconsistent dying declarations by the deceased, then Courts must look for corroborative evidence to find out which dying declaration is to be believed.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 438 \- BNSS \- Section 482 \- Anticipatory Bail-** The presumption of innocence, by itself, cannot be the sole consideration for grant of anticipatory bail. The presumption of innocence is one of the considerations, which the court should keep in mind while considering the plea for anticipatory bail. The salutary rule is to balance the cause of the accused and the cause of public justice. Over solicitous homage to the accused’s liberty can, sometimes, defeat the cause of public justice \- Anticipatory bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances where the Court is prima facie of the view that the applicant has been falsely enroped in the crime or the allegations are politically motivated or are frivolous. (Para 21\) **Corruption Cases \-** If liberty is to be denied to an accused to ensure corruption free society, then the courts should not hesitate in denying such liberty. Where overwhelming considerations in the nature aforesaid require denial of anticipatory bail, it has to be denied. It is altogether a different thing to say that once the investigation is over and charge-sheet is filed, the court may consider to grant regular bail to a public servant \- accused of indulging in corruption.  
**Prevention of Corruption Act 1988-Section 7,13-** Mere demand or solicitation, therefore, by a public servant amounts to commission of an offence under Section 7 of the P.C. Act. The word "attempt" is to imply no more than a mere solicitation, which, again may be made as effectually in implicit or in explicit terms \- Actual exchange of a bribe is not an essential requirement to be prosecuted under this law. Further, those public servants, who do not take a bribe directly, but, through middlemen or touts, and those who take valuable things from a person with whom they have or are likely to have official dealings, are also punishable as per Sections 10 and 11 of the Act 1988 respectively. \- Section 7 is with regard to a public servant taking gratification other than the legal remuneration in respect of an official act. On the other hand, Section 13 of the Act, 1988 is with regard to criminal misconduct by a public servant. A public servant could be said to have committed an offence of criminal misconduct, if he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any other person any gratification other than the legal remuneration as a motive or reward such as mentioned in Section 7 of the Act.

Such ‘satisfaction’ of the detaining authority necessarily has to be spelt out after application of mind by way of separate grounds of detention made by the detaining authority itself and cannot be by inference from a casual reference to the material placed before such detaining authority or a bald recital to the effect that the detaining authority was ‘satisfied on examination of the proposals and supporting documents’ that the detention of the individuals concerned was necessary.

Without a positive proximate act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. Besides, in order to convict a person under Section 306 IPC, there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. (Para 22\)

The detention order being silent on that aspect, we interfere with the detention order only on the ground of the detaining authority having not looked into the conditions imposed by the Magistrate while granting bail for the very same offence; the allegations in which also have led to the preventive detention, assailed herein, to enter a satisfaction as to whether those conditions are sufficient or not to restrain the detenu from indulging in further like activities of smuggling.

**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 406 ; Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 \- Section 138, 142-** Section 142 of the N.I. Act in clear terms, provides the complainant with the right to lodge a complaint, before a court, within whose jurisdiction, the branch of the bank where the cheque is delivered for collection, is situated. Therefore, the argument that another court might also be empowered to take cognizance of the matter under Section 142, since the cause of action arose within that jurisdiction, cannot by itself be a ground for seeking transfer under Section 406 of the Cr.P.C. (Para 55\)  
**Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 \- Section 138, 142-** The complainant can file a complaint before the courts within whose jurisdiction the collection branch of the bank falls (para 63\) \- The word ‘delivered’ used in Section 142(2)(a) of the N.I. Act has no significance. What is of significance is the expression ‘for collection through an account’- The delivery of the cheque takes place where the cheque was issued and presentation of the cheque will be through the account of the payee or holder in due course, and the said place is decisive to determine the question of jurisdiction.(Para 62\)  
**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 406** \- It is only the Supreme Court that has the power to transfer a case pending in a Court subordinate to one High Court to be tried by a Court subordinate to another High Court \- A case is transferred by virtue of the powers under Section 406 if there is a reasonable apprehension on the part of a party to a case that justice will not be done. There, however, must be reliable material from which it can be inferred that there are impediments that are interfering or likely to interfere, either directly or indirectly, with the cause of justice.(Para 31\) \- Some of the broad factors which could be kept in mind while considering an application for transfer of the trial are: (i) when it appears that the State machinery or prosecution is acting hand in glove with the accused, and there is likelihood of miscarriage of justice due to the lackadaisical attitude of the prosecution; (ii) when there is material to show that the accused may influence the prosecution witnesses or cause physical harm to the complainant; (iii)comparative inconvenience and hardships likely to be caused to the accused, the complainant/the prosecution and the witnesses, besides the burden to be borne by the State exchequer in making payment of travelling and other expenses of the official and non-official witnesses; (iv)a communally surcharged atmosphere, indicating some proof of inability in holding a fair and impartial trial because of the accusations made and the nature of the crime committed by the accused; and (v) existence of some material from which it can be inferred that some persons are so hostile that they are interfering or are likely to interfere, either directly or indirectly, with the course of justice. (Para 49)- Mere inconvenience or hardship that the accused may have to face in travelling would not fall within the expression “expedient for the ends of justice”. (Para 65\)  
**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Sections 461,462 \-** If an offender is tried by a Magistrate not empowered by law in that behalf, his proceedings shall be void under Section 461\. Section 462 does not make the principle contained therein to have force notwithstanding anything contained in Section 461.(Para 38\)  
**Cause of action**\- The whole bundle of material facts which it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to entitle him to succeed in the suit.” To ascertain whether the bundle of facts give rise to the cause of action and to determine whether one or more of those facts had occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, the entire plaint needs to be looked into and taken into consideration.

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Execution Petitions \-L**ong and inordinate delay at the end of the Executing Courts across the country in deciding execution petitions \- The mandatory direction requiring the execution proceedings to be completed within six months from the date of filing reiterated \- **Directions issued:** High Courts across the country to call for the necessary information from their respective district judiciary as regards pendency of the execution petitions. Once the data is collected by each of the High Courts, the High Courts shall thereafter proceed to issue an administrative order or circular, directing their respective district judiciary to ensure that the execution petitions pending in various courts shall be decided and disposed of within a period of six months without fail otherwise the concerned presiding officer would be answerable to the High Court on its administrative side. Once the entire data along with the figures of pendency and disposal thereafter, is collected by all the High Courts, the same shall be forwarded to the Registry of this Court with individual reports.  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 47 with Order XXI Rule 101 \-** The questions relating to right, title or interest in a decretal property must be related to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree. The import of such a reading of the provisions is that only matters arising subsequent to the passing of the decree can be determined by an executing court under Section 47 and Order XXI Rule 101.- The issues that ought to have been raised by the parties during the adjudication of the original suit cannot be determined by the executing court as such adjudication may undermine the decree itself- benefit of Section 47 cannot be availed to conduct a retrial causing failure of realisation of fruits of the decree. (Para 62- 63\)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 47 with Order XXI Rule 97 \-** Section 47 is a general provision whereas Order XXI Rules 97 and 101 deal with a specific situation. Moreover, Section 47 deals with executions of all kinds of decrees whereas Order XXI, Rules 97 and 101 deal only with execution of decree for possession **\-E**ven an application filed under Section 47 would be treated as an application under Order XXI Rule 97 and an adjudication is required to be conducted under Rule 98\. Dispossession of the applicant from the property is not a condition for declining to entertain the application. (Para 52-54)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order XXI Rule 97 \-101-** Rules 97 to 101 deal with situation when execution is obstructed or resisted by “any person” claiming right, title or interest in the property. The words “any person” include even a stranger to a decree resisting the decree of possession as not being bound by a decree or by claiming independent right, title or interest to the property. Rule 97 not only provides remedy to a decree holder in obtaining possession of an immovable property but also to a stranger who obstructs or resists delivery of possession of the property by claiming derivative title from the judgment debtor or independent right, title or interest in the decretal property. Whereas, Rule 99 gives right to a third party claiming right, title or interest in the property to seek restoration of the decretal property. Suffice it to say that the remedy under Rule 99 is available when a person claiming right to the decretal property is already dispossessed. (Para 49\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 319, 397-401 \-**Unlike cases where an application under Section 319 is being decided in the first instance by the Trial Court, the conclusion of trial will have no bearing on the adjudication of an application under Section 319 in terms of the directions of the High Court passed in exercise of revisional jurisdiction \- The legal effect of the order passed by the High Court relating back to the original order of the Trial Court is that the Trial Court would not be rendered functus officio for the purpose of considering the application under Section 319 after the conclusion of the trial Trial Court, in considering the application under Section 319 after the conclusion of the trial, merely gives effect to a revisional order directing it to consider the application afresh which it had originally rejected. (Para 115\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 319 \-** Section 319 does not contemplate that a summoned person must be given an opportunity of being heard before being added as an accused to face the trial. A right of hearing would accrue only to a person who is already discharged in the very same proceeding prior to the commencement of the trial. This is different from holding that a person who has been summoned as per Section 319 CrPC has a right of being heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice before being added as an accused to be tried along with the other accused. However, after the rejection of an application under Section 319, a right enures in favour of the proposed accused. Thereafter, if in exercise of revisional jurisdiction, the High Court is to pass an order which is prejudicial to the benefit which had already enured in favour of the proposed accused, then the High Court is obligated in law to provide an opportunity of hearing to the proposed accused. This is also the mandate as contained in sub-section (2) of Section 401 of the CrPC. (Para 115\)

**Public Employment \-** Empanelled/selected candidate can claim no right of appointment, if the State has cogent and germane grounds for not making the appointment. However, at the same time, it is also the law that the appointing authority cannot ignore the select panel or decline to make the appointment on its whims- the policy decision not to carry the process forward must be taken bona fide, there has to be justifiable reason if the process is abandoned mid-way, and such decision must not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or the whims of the decision maker. This acts as a check on the employer’s power deciding against not making any appointment from the select list despite availability of vacancy/vacancies on the advertised/notified public post(s).  
**Public Employment \-** The factors of “when”, “which”, “what”, “who” and “how” that are associated with a recruitment/selection process is the prerogative of the recruiting authority and the selectors; however, at the same time, the process has to be conducted consistent with statutory provisions governing the same, if any, as well as principles of absolute fairness and complete non-arbitrariness. Though it is true that the law does not postulate a fetter on the authority of the employer-State and it is within the domain of the Government when to initiate a process of recruitment for public employment, either according to recruitment rules or even in the absence thereof, it is for the Government of the day to decide in which manner it proposes to conduct selection, what would be the various stages the candidates aspiring for appointment have to pass through in order to be placed in the select list, who would be the selectors, and how weightage is to be given to each of the testing methods, a great deal of credence is lent to a process if it is fairly and transparently conducted in accordance with rules, whatever be its source, without the slightest hint of any bias or favouritism or nepotism. Normally, it is not for the courts to interfere unless the process smacks of mala fides. However, the right to be considered for public employment being a Fundamental Right, it would be safe and prudent to have recruitment rules to govern the process of selection so that the best possible talent is appointed in public service. Obviously, assessing the merit of the candidates aspiring for public employment on the basis of a prescribed standard would not only provide a level playing field for each of them, the excellence of any institution to which the appointment is to be made would depend directly on the proficiency of its members/staff and that would, in turn, depend on the quality and merit of those who offer themselves for selection and ultimately get selected, necessitating the selection to be conducted without any hidden taint or masked mala fides.

**Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 \- Section 42,42A** \- The fields of operation of Section 42 and Section 42A are in completely different spheres. Section 42 specifically deals with the quantum of punishment mandating that when a particular act or omission constitutes an offence, both under the POCSO Act and also under the provisions of the IPC or the Information Technology Act, 2000 then, the offender found guilty of the offence would be liable to punishment under the POCSO Act or under the provisions of the IPC whichever provides a punishment of a greater degree \- Section 42A of POSCO Act, on the other hand, deals with the procedural aspects and gives an overriding effect to the provisions of the POCSO Act over any other law for the time being in force where, the two acts are inconsistent with each other. Hence, the provisions of Section 42A of POSCO Act, by no stretch of imagination, can be interpreted so as to override the scope and ambit of enabling provision, i.e., Section 42 of POCSO Act.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 227 \-** What Section 227 CrPC contemplates is that if upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in this behalf, the judge considers that there is no sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for doing so. At the stage of consideration of discharge, the court is not required to undertake a threadbare analysis of the materials gathered by the prosecution. All that is required to be seen at this stage is that there are sufficient grounds to proceed against the accused. In other words, the materials should be sufficient to enable the court to initiate a criminal trial against the accused. It may be so that at the end of the trial, the accused may still be acquitted. At the stage of discharge, court is only required to consider as to whether there are sufficient materials which can justify launch of a criminal trial against the accused. By its very nature, a discharge is at a higher pedestal than an acquittal. Acquittal is at the end of the trial process, may be for a technicality or on benefit of doubt or the prosecution could not prove the charge against the accused; but when an accused is discharged, it means that there are no materials to justify launch of a criminal trial against the accused. Once he is discharged, he is no longer an accused. (Para 16\)

**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 439- Bail** \- Lack of criminal antecedents and the period of custody are perfectly valid criteria for grant of bail, but the Court while giving due credence to them, cannot lose sight of the primary offence and its effect on society. (Para 9\)

(Para 11\) The evidence of a prosecutrix in a case of rape is of the same value as that of an injured witness and conviction can be made on the basis of the sole testimony of the prosecutrix. (Para 13\) The question of conviction of the accused for rape of the prosecutrix is independent and distinct. It has absolutely no connection with the character of the mother of the prosecutrix and seems to be a dire attempt at using it as a license to discredit the testimony of the prosecutrix. (Para 16\)

When the notice was issued to the appellant, he was not in charge of the corporate debtor as he was suspended from his position as the director of the corporate debtor as soon as IRP was appointed on 25.07.2018. Therefore, the powers vested with the board of directors were to be exercised by the IRP in accordance with the provisions of IBC.

**Environmental Law \- Sustainable Development \-** “Sustainable Development” has been accepted as a viable concept to eradicate poverty and improve the quality of human life, while living within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems. “Sustainable Development” as defined by Brundtland Report means “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs.” The “Sustainable Development” therefore has been held to be a balancing concept between Ecology and Development as a part of the customary international law- Though it is true that the “Precautionary Principle” and the “Polluter Pays Principle” are part of the environmental law of the country, it is equally true that while the right to clean environment is a guaranteed fundamental right under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, the right to development through industrialisation equally claims priority under fundamental rights particularly under Articles 14,19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. There is therefore a need for “Sustainable Development” harmonising and striking a golden balance between the right to development and the right to clean environment. (Para 15-17)

**Legal Maxims and Doctrines** \- Doctrine of “Clean hands and non-suppression of material facts” is applicable with full force to every proceedings before any judicial forum. The party invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India must come with clean hands and disclose all correct and material facts in his Writ Petition. If it is brought to the notice of the Court that the petition has been guilty of suppression of material and relevant facts or has not come with clean hands, such conduct must be seriously viewed by the courts as the abuse of process of law and the petition must be dismissed on that ground alone without entering into the merits of the matter- The rule, suppression of material fact by a litigant disqualifies such litigant from obtaining any relief. This rule has been evolved out of the need of the Courts to deter a litigant from abusing the process of court by deceiving it. (Para 9-10)

However, in cases where the information clearly discloses a cognizable offence, the police have no discretion to conduct a preliminary inquiry before registering an FIR \-Lalita Kumari judgment does not create an absolute rule that a preliminary inquiry must be conducted in every case before the registration of an FIR. Rather, it reaffirms the settled principle that the police authorities are obligated to register an FIR when the information received prima facie discloses a cognizable offence-When the allegations against the accused pertain to the abuse of official position and corrupt practices while holding public office, Such allegations fall squarely within the category of cognizable offences, and there exists no legal requirement for a preliminary inquiry before the registration of an FIR in such cases- (para 12-13)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996** \- Matters such as filling vacancies on arbitral tribunals and the removal of an arbitrator through the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction, in the absence of a clear mechanism within the arbitration agreement, should be normally governed by the law applicable to the arbitration agreement itself, rather than by the procedural rules that govern the arbitration process. It is, after all, the lex arbitri that governs the arbitration and its associated processes. (Para 11\) The mere choice of ‘place’ is not sufficient, in the absence of other relevant factors, to override the presumption in favor of the lex contractus. (Para 31\)  
**Interpretation of Contracts-** To resolve conflicts between competing or inconsistent clauses, the court should read the contract as a whole, striving to give effect to all its provisions. One clause may influence the content of another, and a clause should not be rejected unless it is clearly inconsistent or repugnant to the rest of the agreement- Only when such a reconciliation is not possible will the court consider one clause to prevail over an incorporated standard clause should not be dismissed as redundant unless it is manifestly inconsistent with or repugnant to the rest of the agreement.

To put it differently, the said Rule 4(b) has no relevance as to how the person was appointed to the feeder post (i.e. the post of Assistant Engineer) in the service governed by the Special Rules, 1960\. (Para 24\) \- once a person joins as an Assistant Engineer, i.e. the feeder post under a separate service governed by Special Rules, 1960, then that person irrespective of how he/she has been appointed to that post, has the option to migrate to either the degree or diploma quota, provided he/she has obtained a degree or a diploma.

**Rape cases \- Child witness \-** a. No hard and fast rule can be laid down qua testing the competency of a child witness to testify at trial. b. Whether or not a given child witness will testify is a matter of the Trial Judge being satisfied as to the ability and competence of said witness. To determine the same the Judge is to look to the manner of the witness, intelligence, or lack thereof, as may be apparent; an understanding of the distinction between truth and falsehood etc. c. The non-administration of oath to a child witness will not render their testimony doubtful or unusable. d. The trial Judge must be alive to the possibility of the child witness being swayed, influenced and tutored, for in their innocence, such matters are of ease for those who may wish to influence the outcome of the trial, in one direction or another. e. Seeking corroboration, therefore, of the testimony of a child witness, is well-placed practical wisdom. f. There is no bar to cross-examination of a child witness. If said witness has withstood the cross- examination, the prosecution would be entirely within their rights to seek conviction even solely relying thereon. (Para 14\)

**Motor Accident Compensation \-** Concern expressed regarding mode of payment of compensation in motor accident cases \- The process can be streamlined by directly transferring the amount in the bank accounts of the claimants, so that the Insurance Companies and the claimants are saved from hassles of the court processes- For that purpose, the Tribunals at the initial stage of pleadings or at the stage of leading evidence may require the claimant(s) to furnish their bank account particulars to the Tribunal along with the requisite proof, so that at the stage of passing of the award the Tribunal may direct that the amount of compensation be transferred in the account of the claimant and if there are more than one then in their respective accounts. If there is no bank account, then they should be required to open the bank account either individually or jointly with family members only. It should also be mandated that, in case there is any change in the bank account particulars of the claimant(s) during the pendency of the claim petition they should update the same before the Tribunal. This should be ensured before passing of the final award. It may be ensured that the bank account should be in the name of the claimant(s) and if minor, through guardian(s) and in no case it should be a joint account with any person, who is not a family member. The transfer of the amount in the bank account, particulars of which have been furnished by the claimant(s), as mentioned in the award, shall be treated as satisfaction of the award. Intimation of compliance should be furnished to the Tribunal.

**Service Law \-** Pension is not a charity, or a bounty, and an employee is entitled to receive his pension. As a matter of principle, belated service-related claims need to be rejected on the ground of delay and laches. However, where the claim relates to a continuing wrong, which does not affect the rights of third parties, equities can be balanced by restricting the arrears for the entitlement which a claimant is held to be eligible for- Normally, the period of three years prior to the date of filing of the Writ Petition in the High Court for restricting the consequential relief has been resorted to regarding disbursal of arrears, which is justified. In the present case also, therefore, the benefit of arrears of pension can be restricted to three years prior to the date of filing of the Writ Petition. (Para 19\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** In exercise of writ powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, the high courts of the country do not come to the aid of the tardy, the indolent, and the lethargic. This golden truth has to borne in mind by all courts exercising high prerogative writ jurisdiction. While mandamus will issue to reach injustice, wherever found, it is equally true that exercise of discretion should not unnecessarily be coloured by considerations of sympathy or grace or compassion or charity. These are beyond the scope of the high courts’ writ powers. In cases such as these, where acceptable justification for the failure to act with expedition is not proffered, the high courts should stay at a distance. (Para 18\) \- Quoted from Mani Subrat Jain v. State of Haryana (1977) 1 SCC 486 : no one can ask for a mandamus without a legal right. There must be a judicially enforceable right as well as a legally protected right before one suffering a legal grievance can ask for a mandamus. A person can be said to be aggrieved only when a person is denied a legal right by someone who has a legal duty to do something or to abstain from doing something. (Para 16\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 12-** A ‘deep and pervasive’ control would require much more than just financing an institution or a body. Even guiding, controlling or regulating affairs of an institution will not be called a ‘deep and pervasive’ control. The ‘deep and pervasive’ control requires administrative, financial and functional control of such a body to a much higher degree including interference into its day­ to­ day working, and mere regulatory control cannot mean ‘deep and pervasive’ control. (Para 17\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 12-** ICSSR is indeed an “authority”, within the purview of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. It also controls CRRID to an extent inasmuch as CRRID depends on the funds released by ICSSR as grants. But this itself cannot be called a ‘deep and pervasive’ control- Merely because CRRID is under the control of an authority (as defined under Article 12\) will not make CRRID an authority.

**Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 \- Section 15** \-Confession should be recorded in a free atmosphere. Recording of confessional statements in a heavily guarded BSF camp or in a JIC where the atmosphere for an accused would generally be daunting and overbearing cannot be said to be in a free atmosphere. (Para 26\) Referred to Kartar Singh Vs. State of Punjab (1994) 3 SCC 569- The Legislature had reposed great faith in the fairness and uprightness of the higher police officials in the rank of SP and above while conferring the drastic power of recording confessional statements of the accused persons upon them making the same admissible in evidence subject to fulfillment of the procedural safeguards. But we are afraid, in so far the present case is concerned, the procedural safeguards were given a complete go-bye. The Special Court has stopped short of observing that it was a case of abuse of power and authority. It is indeed a sad reflection as to how investigation and trial unfolded in this case where truth and justice, both for the victims and the accused, remained elusive. It is not for nothing that such draconian provisions have since been repealed. (Para 27\)

**Practice and Procedure \-**Huge pendency of criminal appeals against conviction and acquittal \- Considering the pendency of very old criminal appeals, priority is usually given to the hearing of the appeals where the accused are in prison. The appeals against conviction where the accused are on bail take a backseat. However, a right balance has to be struck by taking up for hearing even some of the old criminal appeals against conviction where accused are on bail. The old age of the accused and the long lapse of time from the commission of the offence can always be a ground available to give some priority to the appeals against conviction of the accused on bail. If the appeals against conviction where the accused are on bail and especially where a life sentence has been imposed are heard after a decade or more from its filing, if the appeal is dismissed, the question arises of sending the accused back to jail after a long period of more than a decade. Therefore, it is desirable that certain categories of appeals against conviction where the accused are on bail should be given priority. (Para 15\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 149** \- Where the evidence on record establishes the fact that a large number of persons were present, it may be safe to convict only those persons against whom overt act is alleged \- **Plurality test \-**The conviction could be sustained only if it is supported by a certain number of witnesses who give a consistent account of the incident \- \- Where a crowd of assailants, who are members of an unlawful assembly, proceeds to commit murder in pursuance of the common object of that assembly, any person who is a member of that unlawful assembly is equally liable even though no specific overt act of assault is attributed to him. Otherwise also, where the assailants are large in number it may not be possible for witnesses to describe accurately the part played by each one of them. Besides, if a large crowd of persons armed with weapons assault the intended victims, it may not be necessary that all of them must take part in the actual assault. Therefore, in a situation like this, what is important for the Court is to determine whether the accused put on trial was a part of the unlawful assembly or just a bystander. Such determination is inferential, based on the proven facts of the case-Accused vicariously liable inter alia, (a) where he had proceeded to the scene of crime along with other members of the assembly carrying arms or instruments which could serve the object of the assembly; and (b) where he had participated in any manner in the events which serve the common object of the assembly.

**Limitation Act \- Section 5** \- All parties, whether or not State under Article 12 of the Constitution, are required to act with due diligence and promptitude- delay cannot be condoned without sufficient cause, but a major aspect which has to be kept in mind is that, if in a particular case, the merits have to be examined, it should not be scuttled merely on the basis of limitation.

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Section 80 \-**The primary objective behind Section 80 of the CPC is to provide the Government or a public officer with an opportunity to assess the legal merits of a claim and potentially settle it if it appears to be just and reasonable (Para 97)- A statutory notice holds significance beyond mere formality. Its purpose is to provide the Government or a public officer with an opportunity to reconsider the matter in light of established legal principles and make a decision in accordance with the law \- A notice issued under Section 80 must include: i. The name, description, and place of residence of the person providing the notice. ii. A statement outlining the cause of action. iii. The relief sought by the plaintiff. \- When determining whether the essential requirements of the Section have been met, the court should consider the following questions: (i) Has the notice provided adequate information to allow the authorities to identify the person issuing the notice? (ii) Have the cause of action and the relief sought by the plaintiff been sufficiently detailed? (iii) Has the written notice been delivered to or left at the office of the appropriate authority as specified in the section? (iv) Has the suit been initiated after the expiration of two months following the delivery or submission of the notice, and does the plaint include a statement confirming that such notice has been provided as required? (Para 103-105)  
**Declaratory title suits against the Government-** Principles that govern the adjudication: i. Suits for declaration of title against the government differ from suits against private parties on two counts: a. First, there is a presumption in favour of the Government in such suits, as all lands which are unoccupied or not vested in any individual or local authority, are presumed to belong exclusively to the Government. b. Secondly, there is an additional burden of proof on the party seeking declaration of title against the Government. The plaintiff has to establish its possession over the land in question for a period of thirty years as opposed to twelve years in the case of adverse possession against a private party. ii. A decree declaring title against the Government must not be passed casually. Before granting any such decree, the trial court must ensure that the plaintiff has furnished adequate documentary evidence, either through title deeds tracing ownership for over thirty years or by establishing adverse possession for a period of thirty years. iii. The trial court must verify whether the name of the plaintiff has been recorded as the owner, holder, or occupant in the relevant revenue or municipal records for more than thirty years. iv. Finally, the trial court must carefully scrutinize the nature of the possession as may be asserted, determining whether the same is authorized or unauthorized, permissive or casual, furtive or clandestine, as well as open, continuous, and hostile, or implied by title, to ensure that public property is not inadvertently converted into private ownership by unscrupulous elements. (Para 88\) Public Authorities must take statutory notice issued to them in all seriousness. The Public Authorities must not sit over such notices and force the citizens to the vagaries of litigation. They are expected to let the plaintiff know their stand within the statutory period or in any case before he embarks upon the litigation. In certain cases, courts may be obliged to draw adverse presumption against the Public Authorities for not acknowledging the notice or telling the plaintiff of its stand and in the absence of that, a stand taken during the course of trial may be considered as an afterthought. (Para 113\)  
**Indian Evidence Act, 1872 \- Section 110 ; Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023- Section 113 \-** Possession is prima facie proof of ownership. A person in possession is entitled to remain in possession until another person can disclose a better title under Section 113 of the BSA. Therefore, once the plaintiff proves that he has been in possession of the suit property, the burden of proving that the plaintiff is not the owner is on the defendant who affirms that the plaintiff is not the owner. The Section does not make a distinction between the Government and a private citizen. Section 113 is, therefore, equally applicable where a Government claims to be the owner or challenges the ownership of the plaintiff who is in possession of the property. It is not disputed that before the possession of the Subject Land was taken over, the plaintiffs were in possession of the property for more than twenty years. The onus, therefore, under section 113 of the BSA was on the State to prove that the Government had a subsisting title to the Subject Land. (Para 72\)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 300A \-** Under the Constitution, the Executive cannot deprive a person of his property of any kind without specific legal authority which can be established in Court of law, however laudable the motive behind such deprivation may be \-In case of dispossession of property except under the authority of law, the owner may obtain restoration of possession by a proceeding for mandamus against the governmental authorities- The phrase “by authority of law” means by or under a law made by the competent Legislature

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 154** \- In the event of any unfortunate incident, such as a suicide occurring on campus, it becomes their unequivocal duty to promptly lodge an F.I.R. with the appropriate authorities. Such action is not only a legal obligation but also a moral imperative to ensure transparency, accountability, and the pursuit of justice. Simultaneously, it is incumbent upon the police authorities to act with diligence and responsibility by registering the FIR without refusal or delay. This ensures that due process of law is upheld, and a thorough investigation can be conducted to uncover the truth and address any underlying causes. (Para 47\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 154 and 174** \- The investigations conducted under Sections 154 and 174 of the CrPC respectively are distinct in nature and purpose- The former begins with information about the commission of a cognizable offence referred to in Section 154(1), culminating in registration of F.I.R. and ending with filing of a chargesheet/challan before the competent court under Section 173 or a final report as the case may be- In contrast, an investigation under Section 174 of the CrPC focuses on ascertaining the apparent cause of death in cases of unnatural or suspicious deaths- The investigation after registration of F.I.R. under Section 154 of the CrPC is an investigation into an offence. In contrast, the investigation under Section 174 of the CrPC is an investigation or an “inquiry” into the apparent cause of death- Sections 174 to 176 of the CrPC only contemplate inquiry into the cause of death. Although the phrase ‘investigation’ is used in Section 174 of the CrPC, yet it is only an investigation in the nature of an inquiry. Sometimes, during the inquest, the police record the presence of witnesses who are also witnesses in the case. These statements are not meant as substitutes for statements under Section 161 of the CrPC. The inquest requirement under Section 174 does use the word investigation but if one considers the entire phraseology of Section 174 of the CrPC, one comes to the conclusion that the word investigation in Section 174 is not an investigation to find out who are the offenders. It is only to enable the police to come up with the “apparent cause of death”. This phrase in Section 174 should give us the clue as to the correct understanding of the role of the police in inquest panchnama. (Para 21-28)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 154** \- i. Registration of an F.I.R. is mandatory under Section 154 of the Code, if the information discloses commission of a cognizable offence and no preliminary inquiry is permissible in such a situation. ii. If the information received does not disclose a cognizable offence but indicates the necessity for an inquiry, a preliminary inquiry may be conducted only to ascertain whether a cognizable offence is disclosed or not. iii. If the inquiry discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, the F.I.R. must be registered. In cases where preliminary inquiry ends in closing the complaint, a copy of the entry of such closure must be supplied to the first informant forthwith and not later than one week. It must disclose reasons in brief for closing the complaint and not proceeding further. iv. The police officer cannot avoid his duty of registering the offence if a cognizable offence is disclosed. Action must be taken against erring officers who do not register an F.I.R. if information received by them discloses a cognizable offence. v. The scope of preliminary inquiry is not to verify the veracity or otherwise of the information received but only to ascertain whether the information reveals any cognizable offence. vi. As to what type and in which cases preliminary inquiry is to be conducted will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The category of cases in which preliminary inquiry may be made are as under: a. Matrimonial disputes/ family disputes b. Commercial offences c. Medical negligence cases d. Corruption cases e. Cases where there is an abnormal delay in initiating criminal prosecution, for example, over three months delay in reporting the matter without satisfactorily explaining the reasons for delay. The aforesaid are only illustrations and not exhaustive of all conditions which may warrant preliminary inquiry. vii. While ensuring and protecting the rights of the accused and the complainant, a preliminary inquiry should be made time bound and in any case it should not exceed 7 days. The fact of such delay and the causes of it must be reflected in the General Diary entry. viii. Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily Diary is the record of all information received in a police station, we direct that all information relating to cognizable offences, whether resulting in registration of an F.I.R. or leading to an inquiry, must be mandatorily and meticulously reflected in the said Diary and the decision to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be reflected, as mentioned above.

**Transfer of Property Act, 1882- Section 122 \-128-** **Gift** \- Delivery of possession is only one of the methods to prove acceptance and not the sole method. The receipt of the original document by the plaintiff and registration of the same, would amount to acceptance of the gift and the transaction satisfies the requirement of Section 122\. (Para 18\) \- For a gift of an immovable property to be valid, it has to be registered, universal cancellation of the gift is impermissible and delivery of possession is not a condition sine qua non to validate the gift. (Para 11\) Once the document is categorized as a gift, in the absence of any clause or reservation to cancel, the executant has no right to cancel the same. The reasons for cancellation or revocation of gift have to be proved in a court of law. (Para 18\)  
**Settlement** \- A disposition of one’s property to another directly or to vest in any such person after successive devolution of rights on other(s). Further, the circumstances and reasons that led to the execution of such a settlement deed are described as its consideration, which need not necessarily be of any monetary value. More often than not, it consists of love, care, affection, duty, moral obligation, or satisfaction, as such deed are typically executed in favour of a family member. Also, a settlor is entitled to reserve a life interest either upon himself or upon others and impose any condition. The person in whose favour, a life interest is created, is permitted to use and enjoy the income arising out of such property during his life time, but has no right of alienation as the property had already vested in the settlee. The breach of any condition in the settlement, would then render the settlement void. However, there are restrictions under the Transfer of Property Act,1882 on the conditions that can be imposed. Section 11 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 states that when by virtue of a transfer, absolute right and interest has been vested in a party, any condition restricting or directing that the property must be enjoyed in a particular manner would be void as it is repugnant to the original grant. Similarly, any condition restraining or limiting the transferee from enjoying the property is also void to that extent. Though under both the situations, the conditions are void, the interest vested already can be enjoyed absolutely as per the will of the transferee. (Para 11.1)  
**Indian Succession Act, 1925 \- Section 2(h) \-** Will is defined under Section 2(h) as a legal declaration of the intention of the testator to be given effect after his death. (Para 11.2)  
**Gift and settlement** \-Gift is a voluntary disposition, it is essentially not an agreement and hence, the element of consideration is taken away from it. Settlement on the other hand is always coupled with consideration as it is mostly executed in favour of a family member. The gift or settlement of an immovable property has to be registered as per Section 17 of the Registration Act. The conditions regarding acceptance, reservation of life interest and restriction on revocation are applicable to both “gift and settlement”. The vesting of the right also takes place in praesenti in both the cases. Therefore, there is an element of gift in every settlement. (Para 11.3)  
**Will and Gift \-** A will is the declaration of the intention of the testator to give away his property. Such will comes into force after the death of the testator. The most important requirement for a valid will is that it must again be a voluntary disposition in sound mind, which must be explicit from the instrument itself \-Every will also has an element of gift, with the difference being the disposition deferred until the death of the testator. Insofar as the revocation is concerned, the testator is at liberty to revoke or alter the will any number of times until his demise, but it is essential that he remains of sound mind while doing so. (Para 11.4)

**Gift, Settlement and Will \-** In case of a gift, it is a gratuitous grant by the owner to another person; in case of a settlement, the consideration is the mutual love, care, affection and satisfaction, independent and resulting out of the preceding factors; in case of a will, it is declaration of the intention of the testator in disposition of his property in a particular manner. (Para 14.1)

**Service Law \- Karnataka Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules, 1977 ; Karnataka Government Servants (Seniority) Rules, 1957 \- Rule 6** \-Transfers characterised as in public interest are founded, sourced, and rooted in administrative exigencies and nothing else. Effecting or transferring employees at their behest is equally important but exercise of that power and discretion is to subserve a different cause or a value, which is distinct from transfer in public interest- If a government employee holding a particular post is transferred on public interest, he carries with him his existing status including seniority to the transferred post. However, if an officer is transferred at his own request, such a transferred employee will have to be accommodated in the transferred post, subject to the claims and status of the other employees at the transferred place, as their interests cannot be varied without there being any public interest in the transfer. Subject to specific provision of the Rules governing the services, such transferees are generally placed at the bottom, below the junior-most employee in the category in the new cadre or department. The rationale in assignment of such seniority is to avoid heartburn of existing employees in the transferred cadre.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 376** \- Once the age of the prosecutrix at the time of the incident is established to be that of minority, the question of consent per se becomes irrelevant and the act shall qualify as statutory rape nevertheless- Subjection to sexual intercourse under fear of accused persons can in no way be understood to mean as consent on part of the prosecutrix \- Normal rule of delay does not apply to rape cases. \[**Context**: SC upheld gang rape conviction and **observed**: Even if the argument of consent is to be considered, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the accused- appellants were men who had held the prosecutrix, who was of a tender age, captive for a prolonged period of time by threatening her life. It would be illogical to rule out the role played by constant fear that the prosecutrix was operating under as she was being subjected to rape by the accused persons over the period of two months.- Such an expression as “being accustomed to sexual intercourse” is nothing but an archaic notion of sexual purity which intends to morally shame the victim and downplay the role of consent, or the lack thereof, in an offence of rape.\]

**Land Acquisition \-** The land acquired is never used in the form it exists. It has to be first developed and made suitable either for habitation or for industrial purposes. In this connection, obviously roads have to be carved out, some open area has to be left for green belts, water, sewerage and electricity lines have to be laid down and the plots have to be carved out into some regular sizes and shapes. In this way, the transferable/saleable area hardly remains to be 50% of the land acquired. In such a situation, the courts have repeatedly held that 30% to 50% deduction be made from the rate for the purposes of such development (Para 11\) Large areas do not attract the same price as is offered for the small plots of lands \- some amount of deduction is also normally permissible on account of largeness in area. Thus, deduction of at least 10% has to be applied to determine the rate of compensation. (Para 12\) The determination of the prevalent market value of the acquired land is not an algebraic formula and that cannot be determined in a precise or an accurate manner. Some amount of guess work is always permissible. Therefore, a judge has to sit in an arm chair and without much taxing his mind has to determine the market value in a prudent manner. (Para 13\)

**Moulding Of Relief \-** The concept of moulding of relief refers to the ability of a court to modify or shape a relief sought by a party in a legal proceeding based on the circumstances of the case and the facts established after a full-fledged trial. The principle enables the court to grant appropriate remedies even if the relief requested in the pleading is not exact or could not be considered by the court or changed circumstances have rendered the relief obsolete. The court aims that justice is served while taking into account the evolving nature of a case. The above road map is pursued by a court based on the notion of flexibility in relief, equitable jurisdiction, and is tempered by judicial discretion. When moulding the relief, the court considers the issues and circumstances established during the full-fledged trial, looks at shortening the litigation, and then in its perspective, renders complete justice to the issue at hand. The converse of the above is that the moulded relief should not take the aggrieved party by surprise or cause prejudice. The relief is moulded as an exception and not as a matter of course- the court of first instance, while exercising the discretion to mould the relief, juxtaposes the consideration with the established conditions of the original relief becoming inappropriate or shortening the litigation and enabling rendering complete justice between the parties. The scrutiny on the moulding of relief by the appellate court tests the exercise of discretion by the trial court, but not in all cases, sit in the very armchair of the court which moulded the relief and re-examine every detail unless prejudice and grave injustice are pointed out against the moulding of relief. In a further appeal on the moulding of relief, the examination by the second appellate court ought to be minimal and not unsettle the settled. (Para 20-25)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 299-304** \-While partly allowing criminal appeal in a road rage case, SC observed: Since the assailants, including the deceased, were not armed and in the midst of a wordy altercation, the accused took out an iron rod and hit one of the assailants on the head; a vital part of the body. Hence, culpability under Section 299 of the I.P.C. though attracted, it does not result in a finding under Section 300 since it falls under Exception 1\. The one blow inflicted on the head of the deceased resulted in his death, that too after five days, which overt act was without any pre-meditation and was occasioned in an altercation where the group comprising the deceased were the aggressors and the offender- appellant herein could be said to have acted under sudden provocation, thus being deprived of the power of self-control. Necessarily, the offence has to be found to be one under Section 304 of the I.P.C. being culpable homicide not amounting to murder. However, under Part I of Section 304 of the I.P.C., since the bodily injury deliberately inflicted was likely to cause death and in such circumstance, the conviction has to be modified to be under Section 304 Part I.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 200** \- Setting criminal law in motion by suppressing material facts and documents is nothing but an abuse of the process of law- Recording the complainant's statement on oath under Section 200 of the CrPC is not an empty formality. The object of recording the complainant's statement and witnesses, if any, is to ascertain the truth. The learned Magistrate is duty-bound to put questions to the complainant to elicit the truth. The examination is necessary to enable the Court to satisfy itself whether there are sufficient grounds to proceed against the accused. (Para 10\)  
**Litigation** \- A litigant who, while filing proceedings in the court, suppresses material facts or makes a false statement, cannot seek justice from the court. The facts suppressed must be material and relevant to the controversy, which may have a bearing on the decision making. Cases of those litigants who have no regard for the truth and those who indulge in suppressing material facts need to be thrown out of the court. (Para 10\)

**Service Law \-** While municipal bodies hold the power to reorganize or rationalize services, such steps must be undertaken by following the prescribed statutory procedure, after due notice, and with proper safeguards for employees’ rights- Abruptly altering the retirement age, merely by reference to a generic classification under recruitment rules, disregards the legitimate expectations of employees who have structured their personal and professional lives around the established service regulations. Such actions strain not only the legal framework but also notions of fairness, particularly when no express legislative or regulatory change was initiated to revise the existing retirement scheme.

**Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 \-Section 26(1) \-** Section 26(1) (b) \- Collector to consider the average sale price for similar types of land situated in the nearest village or the nearest vicinity. This test of average sale price is similar to the exemplar test which is adopted and applied in cases of acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, but with modifications in terms of Explanations 1 to 4\. Computation under Clause (b) is in relative terms. Therefore, while drawing a comparison with the average price of the other lands under Clause (b), the Collector must consider all such factors that have been held to be relevant for accurate valuation by this Court. These include the theory of deduction, the principle of belting, and accounting for other advantages or disadvantages of the acquired land, in comparison to the lands existing in the same vicinity (Para 19)- While the statutory language makes the procedure under Clauses (a), (b) and (c) mandatory, the value as computed according to the Explanations can be increased, decreased or even discarded. (Para 22\) Explanation 4 uses the word “and” in conjoining the values referred to in the two parts of the Explanation. This is done to expand the scope of application of the Collector’s discretion to the entire provision, as is also evident from the phrase “while determining the market value under this section”. The discretion should not be interpreted as restricting the discretion to only the average sale price under Explanations 1 and 2\. The two parts must be given a disjunctive reading, attracting the application of Explanation 4 when either of the values does not reflect the actual market value. Thus, though the word “and” is used to connect the two parts, it should be read as “or” to effectuate the legislative intent. (Para 25\)  
**Theory of deduction \-** The theory of deduction, though not statutorily prescribed, has been applied by courts to compute the compensation payable under the Acquisition Act, 1894 primarily for two reasons. First, consideration of the potential value of the land can result in arriving at an enhanced or increased value, especially for undeveloped lands. Secondly, in acquisitions of large underdeveloped lands, a significant portion of the land would have to be utilised for making minimum amenities like roads, drains, sewers, water and electrical lines available. Thus, making the land usable would involve a substantial expense for the buyer in the form of development charges. (Para 6\)  
**Interpretation of Statutes** \- Explanations can form part of the main provision and, when so, can be as central as the provision itself- an explanation appended to a Section or Clause gets incorporated into it, becomes an integral part of it, and has no independent existence apart from it. There is, in the eye of law, only one enactment, of which both the Section and the Explanation are two inseparable parts. They move in a body if they move at all. (Para 22\)  
**Circle Rates \-** Fixing fair and accurate circle rates has a direct impact on each citizen. An inflated rate results in an unfair financial burden on purchasers. Conversely, an undervalued rate leads to inadequate stamp duty collection, adversely affecting the State’s revenue. Circle rates which reflect the market price ensure proper revenue collection for the State by preventing under-valuation of properties. (Para 35\)

**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 173(3) ; Constitution of India \- Article 19(2) \-** When an allegation is of the commission of an offence covered by the law referred to in clause (2) of Article 19, if sub- Section (3) of Section 173 is applicable, it is always appropriate to conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether a prima facie case is made out to proceed against the accused. This will ensure that the fundamental rights guaranteed under sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of Article 19 remain protected. Therefore, in such cases, the higher police officer referred to in sub- Section (3) of Section 173 must normally grant permission to the police officer to conduct a preliminary inquiry.  
**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 173(3) \-**Sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS makes a significant departure from Section 154 of CrPC- In the category of cases covered by sub-Section (3), a police officer is empowered to make a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether a prima facie case is made out for proceeding in the matter even if the information received discloses commission of any cognizable offence- After holding a preliminary inquiry, if the officer comes to a conclusion that a prima facie case exists to proceed, he should immediately register an FIR and proceed to investigate. But, if he is of the view that a prima facie case is not made out to proceed, he should immediately inform the first informant/complainant so that he can avail a remedy under sub-Section (4) of Section 173\. (Para 42- i-ii)  
**Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 \- Section 196 \-** Mens rea will have to be read into Section 196 (Para 34\) \- When an offence punishable under Section 196 of BNS is alleged, the effect of the spoken or written words will have to be considered based on standards of reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous individuals and not based on the standards of people with weak and oscillating minds. The effect of the spoken or written words cannot be judged on the basis of the standards of people who always have a sense of insecurity or of those who always perceive criticism as a threat to their power or position. (Para 42-vi) In case of the offence punishable under Section 196 of the BNS to decide whether the words, either spoken or written or by sign or by visible representations or through electronic communication or otherwise, lead to the consequences provided in the Section, the police officer to whom information is furnished will have to read or hear the words written or spoken, and by taking the same as correct, decide whether an offence under Section 196 is made out. Reading of written words, or hearing spoken words will be necessary to determine whether the contents make out a case of the commission of a cognizable offence. The same is the case with offences punishable under Sections 197, 299 and 302 of BNS. Therefore, to ascertain whether the information received by an officer-in-charge of the police station makes out a cognizable offence, the officer must consider the meaning of the spoken or written words. This act on the part of the police officer will not amount to making a preliminary inquiry which is not permissible under sub-Section (1) of Section 173\. (Para 42-iii)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 12 \-** The police machinery is a part of the State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. Moreover, the police officers being citizens, are bound to abide by the Constitution. They are bound to honour and uphold freedom of speech and expression conferred on all citizens. (Para 42-iv)  
**Constitution of India \- Preamble** \- The philosophy of the Constitution and its ideals can be found in the preamble itself. The preamble lays down that the people of India have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic and to secure all its citizens liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. Therefore, liberty of thought and expression is one of the ideals of our Constitution. (Para 42-iv)  
**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 528 ; Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \- Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** There is no absolute rule that when the investigation is at a nascent stage, the High Court cannot exercise its jurisdiction to quash an offence by exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or under Section 482 of the CrPC equivalent to Section 528 of the BNSS. When the High Court, in the given case, finds that no offence was made out on the face of it, to prevent abuse of the process of law, it can always interfere even though the investigation is at the nascent stage. It all depends on the facts and circumstances of each case as well as the nature of the offence. There is no such blanket rule putting an embargo on the powers of the High Court to quash FIR only on the ground that the investigation was at a nascent stage. (Para 42-vii)  
**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 \- Section 173** \- The allegations made in the information furnished to an officer-in-charge of a police station must be examined by the officer only with a view to ascertain whether a cognizable offence is made out. Taking the information as correct, the officer has to determine whether it makes out a case of the commission of a cognizable offence. If the allegation makes out a case of a cognizable offence, unless the offence falls in sub-Section (3) of Section 173, it is mandatory to register FIR. (Para 25\)  
**Quotable Quotes-** Free expression of thoughts and views by individuals or group of individuals is an integral part of a healthy civilised society. Without freedom of expression of thoughts and views, it is impossible to lead a dignified life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. In a healthy democracy, the views, opinions or thoughts expressed by an individual or group of individuals must be countered by expressing another point of view. Even if a large number of persons dislike the views expressed by another, the right of the person to express the views must be respected and protected. Literature including poetry, dramas, films, stage shows including stand-up comedy, satire and art, make the lives of human beings more meaningful. The Courts are duty-bound to uphold and enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India. Sometimes, we, the Judges, may not like spoken or written words. But, still, it is our duty to uphold the fundamental right under Article 19 (1)(a). We Judges are under an obligation to uphold the Constitution and respect its ideals. If the police or executive fail to honour and protect the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19 (1)(a) of the Constitution, it is the duty of the Courts to step in and protect the fundamental rights. There is no other institution which can uphold the fundamental rights of the citizens. (Para 42-viii) 75 years into our republic, we cannot be seen to be so shaky on our fundamentals that mere recital of a poem or for that matter, any form of art or entertainment, such as, stand-up comedy, can be alleged to lead to animosity or hatred amongst different communities. Subscribing to such a view would stifle all legitimate expressions of view in the public domain which is so fundamental to a free society. (Para 42-ix)

**Customs Act, 1962 \- Most Akin Test** \- If the attributes of the imported goods show that the goods are “most akin” to the specified goods amongst an array of other specified goods, these imported goods have to be classified as the specified goods with which these goods bear the most resemblance or most akinness. Thus, in our view, application of the principle of preponderance of probability does not provide an accurate test. The more accurate and precise test will be whether the goods in question are “most akin” or most similar to the specified goods- (Para 81-83) **Direction**: Ensure that proper facilities are made available in the appropriate laboratories for undertaking tests for all these parameters or at least for those parameters which the Authorities consider are of essential character to satisfy the “most akin” test without which the article in issue cannot be properly classified. (Para 88\) Expression “preponderance of probability” in contradistinction to “proof beyond reasonable doubt”- there may be varying range in the degree of probabilities. Certainly, where the proceedings involve requirement of fulfilment of technical/scientific parameters with confiscatory and penal consequences, the degree of probability would be of a higher order and not mere probability. (Para 77-78)  
**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 45 \-** The opinion of the experts, however weighty they may be, are not binding on the court and is only relevant for the court to consider it to come to a final decision on any fact in issue. However, since courts are not experts in the discipline of science, they ordinarily accept the scientific report and act upon it. But where the expert opinion suffers from certain shortcomings or ambiguities, lack of clarity, or inadequacy, it would be subject to judicial scrutiny and it would not be safe to rely wholly on the same under such circumstances.

**Constitution of India \- Article 311(1)** \- If one looks at Article 311(1), the sole safeguard that it provides to any member, inter alia, of a civil service of a State or the holder of a civil post under the State is that he shall not be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed (emphasis supplied). Clause (1) does not on its own terms require that the disciplinary proceedings should also be initiated by the appointing authority. (Para 33\) Unless the relevant discipline and appeal rules applicable to an officer/employee of an authority within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution so require, disciplinary proceedings by issuance of a charge-sheet cannot be faulted solely on the ground that either the Appointing Authority or the Disciplinary Authority has not issued the same or approved it. (Para 26\)  
**Constitution of India- Article 226 \-** In some very rare and exceptional cases the High Court can quash a show cause notice or charge-sheet if it is found to be wholly without jurisdiction or for some other reason it is wholly illegal (emphasis supplied). However, ordinarily the High Court should not interfere in such a matter. (Para 11\)  
**Precedents** \- Each decision is an authority for what it decides and not what could logically be deduced therefrom. Mechanical reliance on precedents, as if they are statutes, has been deprecated. Whenever a precedent is cited laying down a principle of law having application to the facts of the case in hand and having binding effect, it is customary and expected of courts to be bound by the law declared by this Court under Article 141 of the Constitution. However, the courts are free not to place blind reliance on whatever precedent is cited by the parties since facts of two cases are not seldom alike. It is the duty of the court, if it considers the precedent not to be applicable, to refer to factual dissimilarities that are found and thereafter to distinguish the precedent cited before it by assigning brief but cogent reasons. (Para 35\) Quoted from Regional Manager, Food Corporation of India v. Pawan Kumar Dubey: "... It is the rule deducible from the application of law to the facts and circumstances of a case which constitutes its ratio decidendi and not some conclusion based upon facts which may appear to be similar. One additional or different fact can make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases even when the same principles are applied in each case to similar facts”. (Para 35\)

State of Chattisgarh \- To avoid suspicious circumstances and to ensure fair procedure in respect of search and seizure, it is always desirable to follow the standing order which provides suitable guidance for the officers investigating crimes under the NDPS Act. Should there be any departure, the same must be based on justifiable and reasonable grounds. \[**Context**: In this case , the Investigating Officer kept the seized contraband in a separate room in his office for fifteen days \- SC observed: This could give rise to an allegation that the seized contraband was by itself substituted and some other items planted to falsely implicate the accused.\]

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 256** \- What assumes importance for invoking Section 256, Cr. PC is the purpose for which the case is fixed- If the date is not appointed for appearance of the accused but for some other purpose, acquittal of the accused does not necessarily follow as the logical result of absence of the complainant. Also, the words “on any day subsequent thereto” must be understood in reference to the words preceding, namely, “the day appointed for the appearance of the accused”. Say, for instance, if a date is fixed by the magistrate for bringing an order from a superior court or for showing cause why an order of dismissal should not be passed for continuous absence of the complainant or for producing any material, which is not intrinsically connected with any step towards progress of the lis, and the complainant is found to be absent, a dismissal of the complaint can be ordered but the provision for acquitting the accused may not be attracted unless it happens to be the date appointed for appearance of the accused and they do appear personally or through an advocate; also, without the magistrate recording a clear acquittal along with the order of dismissal of the complaint, acquittal need not be read into every such order of dismissal of a complaint owing to absence of the complainant.

**Disciplinary Proceedings \- Delay** \- Whether delay is a ground for stopping the departmental proceedings at the stage of the chargesheet itself, suffice it to say that this varies from case to case \- Where there is unexplained inordinate delay in initiating departmental proceedings despite the alleged misconduct being within the knowledge of the department, but still no departmental proceedings are initiated, the answer must go in favour of the employee. However, there may be cases where the department was not even aware of such irregularities or the misconduct, which is of such a nature that it is indicative, based on material considerations of factors other than merit, such as extraneous influences and gratifications. In such cases, such a delay, by itself would not be a valid ground to scuttle the initiation of the process of departmental proceedings. (Para 17\)  
**Disciplinary Proceedings \-** Situations where the government is not precluded from taking disciplinary actions for violation of the Code of Conduct: \- “(i) Where the officer had acted in a manner as would reflect on his reputation for integrity or good faith or devotion to duty; (ii) If there is prima facie material to show recklessness or misconduct in the discharge of his duty; (iii) if he has acted in a manner which is unbecoming of a Government servant; (iv) if he had acted negligently or that he omitted the prescribed conditions which are essential for the exercise of the statutory powers; (v) if he had acted in order to unduly favour a party; (vi) if he had been actuated by corrupt motive however, small the bribe may be because Lord Coke said long ago “though the bribe may be small, yet the fault is great- Mere technical violations or the fact that an order is wrong, if not falling under the above enumerated instances, does not warrant disciplinary actions- Each case depends on its facts, and absolute rules cannot be postulated. The above instances as referred and reproduced hereinabove, are thus only a guide and not meant to be mandatorily adhere to without exception \- Quoted from Union of India and others vs. K.K. Dhawan (1993) 2 SCC 56\.

### [**I.K. Merchants Pvt. Ltd. vs State Of Rajasthan 2025 INSC 418 \- S. 34 CPC \- Grant Of Interest- Public Interest**](https://www.caseciter.com/untitled-7/)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 34** \-Court to grant interest at three different stages of a money decree viz., (i) the court may award interest on the principal sum claimed at a rate it deems reasonable, for the period before the suit was filed. Such interest is generally governed by agreements between the parties; (ii) The court may award interest on the principal amount from the date of filing the suit until the date of the decree, at a reasonable rate. Here, the court has full discretion to determine the interest rate based on fairness, commercial usage and equity; and (iii)the court may grant interest on the total decretal amount (principal \+ interest before decree) from the date of the decree until payment, at a rate not exceeding 6% per annum unless otherwise specified in contractual agreements or statutory provisions. However, if the claim arises from a commercial transaction, courts may allow interest at a higher rate based on agreements between the parties- Courts have the authority to determine the appropriate interest rate, considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in accordance with law. That apart, the Courts have the discretion to decide whether the interest is payable from the date of institution of the suit, a period prior to that, or from the date of the decree, depending on the specific facts of each case- while the discretion to award interest, whether pendente lite or post-decree, is well recognized, its exercise must be guided by equitable considerations. The rate and period of interest cannot be applied mechanically or at an unreasonably high rate without any rationale.rationale. Though it is not possible to arrive at the actual value of improvement or the inflation on the fair consideration, if paid at the relevant point of time, it is just and necessary that the rate of interest must be a reparation for the appellant. The Court must ensure that while the claimant is fairly compensated, the award does not become punitive or unduly burdensome on the Judgement Debtor. Therefore, the rate of interest should be determined in a manner that balances both fairness and financial impact, taking into account the “loss of use” principle and economic prudence, in the specific facts of each case. (Para 13-16)  
**Words and Phrases \- Public Interest \-** The term “Public Interest” denotes a wider concept with its genus rooted to the welfare of the public at large, with different species attributable to individual and specific impact, depending upon the concept and the subject under consideration. It deals with the impact of a policy decision on the society. Generally, public interest is anathema to commercial transactions. However, by exception, when the terms are oppressive or one-sided, they are to be termed as unconscionable, arbitrary and by application of externalities, public interest will have to lean towards the individual who has been wronged, as such contracts are deemed to take away the fairness, affecting the free consent required to culminate into a valid contract. The constitutional courts, under such circumstances will be armed with Article 14 to strike down such contracts or to pass appropriate decrees or orders. (Para 12\)

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016- Section 31** \- Once the RP is approved by the Adjudicating Authority, after it is satisfied that the RP as approved by the CoC meets the requirements as referred to in sub-section (2) of Section 30, it shall be binding on the CD and its employees, members, creditors, guarantors and stakeholders. The legislature has consciously not provided for a ground to challenge the justness of the “commercial decision” taken by the Financial Creditors, because one of the dominant purposes of the IBC is revival of the CD and to make it a running concern- While considering the feasibility and viability of the Prospective Resolution Plans, the CoC can always suggest a modification therein and exercise its commercial wisdom. However, once the RP is approved by the requisite majority of CoC, and when such RP is placed before the Adjudicating Authority for its approval under Section 31, the Adjudicating Authority has to only see whether such RP as approved by the CoC meets the requirements as referred to in Section 30(2). It is only where the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that the RP does not confirm to the requirements of sub-section (1) of Section 31, it may by an order reject the RP. It is true that the NCLT has to decide all the questions on law or fact arising out of or in relation to the insolvency resolution or liquidation under the residuary jurisdiction vested in NCLT under Section 60(5), such residual jurisdiction does not in any manner impact Section 30(2) of the Code, which circumscribes the jurisdiction of the Adjudicating Authority, when it comes to the confirmation of RP, as has been mandated by Section 31(1) of the Code. (Para 42-43)  
**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016- Section 61 \- T**he scope of interference by the Appellate Authority i.e., NCLAT under Section 61 in the Appeals arising out of the order approving a RP under Section 31, is also very limited and restricted to the specific grounds mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 61\. The grounds for filing Appeal under Section 61 have to be confined to sub-section (3) thereof. (Para 44\)  
**International Doctrines \-**The Court should be wary of transplanting international doctrines, which might have been evolved as responses to the specific needs of the jurisdictional regimes. (Para 80\)  
**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016- Chapters III and VI \-** Both, the Avoidance Applications under Chapter III and the Applications in respect of Fraudulent trading or Wrongful trading under Chapter VI, operate in different situations. The powers of the Adjudicating Authority in respect of the Avoidance Applications filed under Chapter III and the powers of the Adjudicating Authority in respect of the Applications pertaining to the Fraudulent and Wrongful trading filed under Chapter VI, have also been separately circumscribed- the Applications filed in respect of “Fraudulent and Wrongful trading” carried on by the CD, could not be termed as “Avoidance Applications” used for the Applications filed under Sections 43, 45 and 50 to avoid or set aside the Preferential, Undervalued or Extortionate transactions, as the case may be. There is clear demarcation of powers of the Adjudicating Authority to pass orders in the Avoidance Applications filed by the Resolution Professional under Section 43, 45 and 50 falling under Chapter III and the Applications filed by the Resolution Professional in respect of the Fraudulent and Wrongful trading of CD, under Section 66 falling under Chapter VI of the IBC. If the Resolution Professional has filed common applications under Sections 43, 45, 50 and also under Section 66, the Adjudicating Authority shall have to distinguish the same and decide as to which provision would be attracted to which of the Applications, and then shall exercise the powers and pass the orders in terms of the provisions of IBC. (Para 56-61)  
**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016- Section 30,31 \-** The entire process right from the submission of RPs by the PRAs till the final approval/rejection of the Plan by the Adjudicating Authority has been duly prescribed, which is mandatory in nature. If there is any non-compliance of the mandatory requirements stated in Section 30(2) of IBC, readwith Regulation 38 of the Regulations, 2016, the Adjudicating Authority is empowered to reject the plan as envisaged in sub-section (2) of Section 31\. If however, the plan approved by the CoC as per Section 30(4), meets with the requirements under Section 30(2), the Adjudicating Authority has to approve such plan under Section 31(1), which would be binding to all the stakeholders as stated therein. (Para 65\)  
**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 74 \-** The RP after having been approved by the NCLT under Section 31 of IBC, would become a Public Document within the meaning of Section 74 of the Indian Evidence Act. (Para 110\)

**Constitution of India- Article 226 \- Judicial Review \-** Normally, courts should not interfere with the decisions taken by expert statutory bodies regarding academic matter: may it relate to qualification for admission of students or qualification required by teachers for appointment, salary, promotion, entitlement to a higher pay scale etc. However, this does not mean that Courts are deprived of their powers of judicial review. It only means that courts must be slow in interfering with the opinion of experts in regard to academic standards and powers of judicial review should only be exercised in cases where prescribed qualification or condition is against the law, arbitrary or involves interpretation of any principle of law- where a candidate does not possess the minimum qualifications, prescribed by an expert body, for appointment or promotion to a particular post in an educational institution, such a candidate will not be entitled to get appointed or will be deprived of certain benefits- Responsibility, of fixing qualifications for purposes of appointment, promotion etc. of staff or qualifications for admissions, is that of expert bodies (in the present case, the AICTE), and so long as qualifications prescribed are not shown to be arbitrary or perverse, the Courts will not interfere.

(Para 46\) Considering the technical and regulatory imperatives involved, the 24-hour advance notice condition under Regulation 26(7) cannot be considered ultra vires, as it falls within the regulatory domain of the State Commission to establish fair, transparent, and non- disruptive mechanisms for open access. (Para 58\) The Regulations of 2016 are consistent with the legislative intent of the Act of 2003, ensuring that open access is exercised in a manner that does not compromise system stability, fairness, or economic viability. Therefore, the regulatory framework does not foreclose open access but rather operationalizes it within reasonable constraints essential for sustaining the electricity sector. (Para 65\)

**Quotable Quotes-** Lack of public employment opportunities in sufficient numbers may force even a Master degree holder to apply for the job of a peon but, if he is appointed upon his application being favourably considered, what happens to the aspirants who have not had the means of pursuing study beyond the 12th standard? Do they remain unemployed for ever, if all or majority of the posts of peon are filled up by such degree holders? What happens if the Master degree holder, in pursuit of greener pastures, leaves the post of Peon for a better and secured higher job commensurate with his qualifications after a couple of years? Does it not, in such a case, burden the public exchequer by requiring the employer to initiate a fresh selection process? Is not the State, as a model employer, obliged to ensure that the posts of peon are filled up only by those having the basic qualification, and not by over qualified candidates, for sub-serving the common good? Does not the State have the obligation to strive to ensure that all citizens have adequate means of livelihood?

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 31 \- Arbitration Act 1940** \-Under the 1940 Act, a stricter approach is followed that requires a clear and express clause against the payment of interest in case of difference, dispute, or misunderstanding, in case of delay of payment, or any other case whatsoever, to constitute a bar on the arbitrator from granting interest. A clause that only provides that interest shall not be granted on amounts payable under the contract would not be sufficient. On the other hand, under the 1996 Act wherein Section 31(7)(a) sanctifies party autonomy, interest is not payable the moment the contract provides otherwise-(Para 10\) The arbitrator’s power to grant interest would depend on the contractual clause in each case, and whether it expressly takes away the arbitrator’s power to grant pendente lite interest. This would have to be determined based on the phraseology of the agreement, clauses conferring powers relating to arbitration, the nature of claim and dispute referred to the arbitrator, and on what items the power to award interest is contractually barred and for which period. Further, a bar on award of interest for delayed payment would not be readily inferred as an express bar to the award of pendente lite interest by the arbitrator. (Para 13\)

**Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 \- Section 4,6-** if a society is unable to comply with the pre-condition or pre- requisite in regard to the economic viability of the society, allowing the registration of such a society which might not even be able to function, it may adversely affect the members of the society and, ultimately, it would be frustrating the very object of the establishment of the said society.

**Government Resolutions \-** State Government may use its discretion for relaxation of conditions. However, such a discretion cannot be used to frustrate the very object of the Act. Such a power of relaxing the necessary pre-requisites could have been made only through the means of a Government Resolution and not at the whims of the State in an appeal which essentially led to by-passing the eligibility criteria set out by the Government through its multiple Resolutions. Once such an eligibility standard has been set out by the Government, the only proper route to introduce any alteration or relaxation of these conditions would have been through a subsequent Government Resolution.

**Public Employment \- Selection Process** \- When an in-depth factual inquiry reveals systemic irregularities, such as malaise or fraud, that undermine the integrity of the entire selection process, the result should be cancelled in its entirety. However, if and when possible, segregation of tainted and untainted candidates should be done in consonance with fairness and equity. • The decision to cancel the selection en masse must be based on the satisfaction derived from sufficient material collected through a fair and thorough investigation. It is not necessary for the material collected to conclusively prove malpractice beyond a reasonable doubt. The standard of evidence should be reasonable certainty of systemic malaise. The probability test is applicable. • Despite the inconvenience caused to untainted candidates, when broad and deep manipulation in the selection process is proven, due weightage has to be given to maintaining the purity of the selection process. • Individual notice and hearing may not be necessary in all cases for practical reasons when the facts establish that the entire selection process is vitiated with illegalities at a large scale.  
**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** Evidence Act does not strictly apply to the proceedings in a Writ Court and the decision is rendered based on the evidence and material on record. (Para 39\)  
**Acquiescence, delay and laches-** They have distinct characteristics, though the underlying principle remains one of estoppel. Laches refers to remissness or slackness, involving unreasonable delay or negligence in seeking equitable relief, which prejudices the other party. It arises from the neglect of a party to assert their right, thereby preventing them from obtaining relief \- The principle of acquiescence also does not apply, as it assumes knowledge of the act, followed by passive acceptance- Delay, as a general principle, encompasses both laches and acquiescence, and delay is always fact-specific. (Para 43\)  
**Natural Justice** \- The principles of natural justice cannot be invoked to validate the fraud that has occurred. These principles are not rigid or inflexible; rather, they must be applied with due regard to the specific facts and circumstances at hand. (Para 44\)

**Code Of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 197 ; Karnataka Police Act \- Section 170**\- Any action undertaken by a public officer, even if in excess of the authority vested in them or overstepping the confines of their official duty, would nonetheless attract statutory protection, provided there exists a reasonable nexus between the act complained of and the officer’s official functions (Para 39\) \- A mere excess or overreach in the performance of official duty does not, by itself, disentitle a public servant from the statutory protection mandated by law. (Para 40\) The underlying rationale of both these statutory provisions is to safeguard public functionaries from frivolous or vexatious prosecution for actions undertaken in good faith in the discharge of, or purported discharge of, their official duties, thereby ensuring that the fear of litigation does not impede the efficient functioning of public administration. (Para 31\) The pivotal inquiry is whether the impugned act is reasonably connected to the discharge of official duty. If the act is wholly unconnected or manifestly devoid of any nexus to the official functions of the public servant, the requirement of sanction is obviated. Conversely, where there exists even a reasonable link between the act complained of and the official duties of the public servant, the protective umbrella of Section 197 of the CrPC and Section 170 of the Police Act is attracted. In such cases, prior sanction assumes the character of a sine qua non, regardless of whether the public servant exceeded the scope of authority or acted improperly while discharging his duty.

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 \- Section 96 ; Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 \- Section 138 \-** The statutory liability against the directors under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881, is personal and hence, continues to bind natural persons, irrespective of any moratorium applicable to the corporate debtor. The acceptance of the resolution plan under Section 31 IBC or its implementation thereof will have no effect on the prosecution under Section 138 of the N.I. Act (Para 13)- Similarly, the acceptance of the report by the resolution professional under Section 100 and the moratorium under Section 101, which reprises Section 96, will not bar the continual of any criminal action \-The object of moratorium or for that purpose, the provision enabling the debtor to approach the Tribunal under Section 94 is not to stall the criminal prosecution, but to only postpone any civil actions to recover any debt. The deterrent effect of Section 138 is critical to maintain the trust in the use of negotiable instruments like cheques in business dealings. Criminal liability for dishonoring cheques ensures that individuals who engage in commercial transactions are held accountable for their actions, however subject to satisfaction of other conditions in the N.I. Act, 1881- Allowing to evade prosecution under Section 138 by invoking the moratorium would undermine the very purpose of the N.I. Act, 1881, which is to preserve the integrity and credibility of commercial transactions and the personal responsibility persists, regardless of the insolvency proceedings and its outcome. (Para 17\) \- The distinction between the right to sue based on a dishonoured cheque by initiating a civil suit and launching a prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is significant. In case of former, the interim moratorium can operate, but not in case of later. (Para 13\)  
**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 \- Section 96** \- Section 96 IBC provides that any legal proceedings pending against the debtor concerning any debt shall be deemed to have been stayed. The term “any legal action or proceedings” does not mean “every legal action or proceedings”. In sub-clauses 96 (b) (i) and (ii), the term “legal action or proceedings” are followed by the term “in respect of any debt”. The term “legal action or proceedings” would have to be understood to include such legal action or proceedings relating to recovery of debt by invoking the principles of noscitur a sociius. The purpose of interim moratorium contemplated under Section 96 is to be derived from the object of the act, which is not to stall the proceedings unrelated to the recovery of the debt. The protection is not available against penal actions, the object of which is to not recover any debt. This moratorium serves as a critical mechanism, allowing the debtor to reorganize their financial affairs without the immediate threat of creditor actions. The clear and unequivocal language of this provision reflects the legislative intent to provide a protective shield for debtors during the insolvency process. (Para 12\)

**Specific Relief Act 1963 \- Section 16-‘**Readiness’ and ‘willingness’ are not one but two separate elements. ‘Readiness’ means the capacity of the buyer to perform the contract, which would include the financial position to pay the sale consideration. ‘Willingness’ refers to the intention of the buyer as a purchaser to perform his part of the contract, which is inferred by scrutinising the conduct of the buyer /purchaser, including attending circumstances-Continuous readiness and willingness on the part of the buyer /purchaser from the date of execution of Agreement to Sell till the date of the decree, is a condition precedent for grant of relief of specific performance- It is not enough to show the readiness and willingness up to the date of the plaint as the conduct must be such as to disclose readiness and willingness at all times from the date of the contract and throughout the pendency of the suit up to the decree- The readiness and willingness of the buyer to go ahead with the sale of the property at the time of the institution of the suit loses its relevance, if the buyer is unable to establish that the readiness and willingness has continued throughout the pendency of the suit.(Para 17-20)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 376 \-** There is a growing tendency of resorting to initiation of criminal proceedings when relationships turn sour. Every consensual relationship, where a possibility of marriage may exist, cannot be given a colour of a false pretext to marry, in the event of a fall out. It is such lis that amounts to an abuse of process of law- \[ **Context**: SC while quashing criminal proceedings against accused, observed: Even if we take the case of the Complainant at the face value or consider that the relationship was based on an offer of marriage, the Complainant cannot plead ‘misconception of fact’ or ‘rape on the false pretext to marry’. It is from day one that she had knowledge and was conscious of the fact, that the Appellant was in a subsisting marriage, though separated. It is upon having an active understanding of the circumstances, actions and the consequences of the acts, that the Complainant made a reasoned choice to sustain a relationship with the Appellant.\]

Where two views were possible, it is also trite, that the one taken by the Trial Court to acquit the accused, if found to be a plausible one, cannot be upset lightly by the Appellate Court. The presumption of innocence available to an accused gets further fortified by the acquittal entered by the Trial Court. (Para 6\)  
**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 106 \-** When an accused is alleged to have committed the murder of his wife; if the prosecution establishes that shortly before the crime, they were seen together or the offence takes place in the dwelling home where the husband also resides, then if the accused does not offer any explanation or offers an explanation which is palpably false; that would be a strong circumstance, establishing his culpability in the crime. However, it cannot be the sole circumstance leading to the conclusion of guilt on the part of the accused husband. (Para 9\)  
**Circumstantial Evidence** \- A mere suspicion cannot lead to a finding of guilt, especially when there is not available a chain of circumstances, unequivocally pointing to the guilt of the accused in the alleged crime. (Para 9\)

**Registration Act 1908 \-** No provision under the 1908 Act confers power on any authority to refuse registration of a transfer document on the ground that the documents regarding the title of the vendor are not produced, or if his title is not established. (Para 11\) It is not the function of the Sub-Registrar or Registering Authority to ascertain whether the vendor has title to the property which he is seeking to transfer. Once the registering authority is satisfied that the parties to the document are present before him and the parties admit execution thereof before him, subject to making procedural compliances as narrated above, the document must be registered. The execution and registration of a document have the effect of transferring only those rights, if any, that the executant possesses. If the executant has no right, title, or interest in the property, the registered document cannot effect any transfer. (Para 15\)  
**Registration Rules under the Registration Act, 1908 \-** Rule 55A(i) is inconsistent with the provisions of the 1908 Act and declared as ultra vires the 1908 Act \- Rule 55A empowered the registering officer to refuse registration unless the presentant produces the original deed by which the executant acquired rights over the subject property and an encumbrance certificate pertaining to the property, obtained within ten days from the date of presentation.

### [**Annaya Kocha Shetty (D) vs Laxmibai Narayan Satose 2025 INSC 466 \- Contract \- Ss.91,92 Evidence Act \- Pleadings and Judgment**](https://www.caseciter.com/annaya-kocha-shetty-d-vs-laxmibai-narayan-satose-2025-insc-466-contract-ss-91-92-evidence-act-pleadings-and-judgment/)

**Contracts** \- The guide to the construction of deeds and tools adopted can broadly be summarised as follows: (1) The contract is first constructed in its plain, ordinary and literal meaning. This is also known as the literal rule of construction \- (2) If there is an absurdity created by literally reading the contract, a shift from literal rule may be allowed. This construction is generally called the golden rule of construction (3) Lastly, the contract may be purposively constructed in light of its object and context to determine the purpose of the contract. This approach must be used cautiously. (Para 17\)  
**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 91,92 \-** The construction of a deed is “generally speaking, a matter of law.” However, when there is an ambiguity in the deed, determining its meaning is a mixed question of fact and law \- This concept is encapsulated by sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act, 1872 \- The evidence to vary the terms of an agreement in writing is not admissible, but evidence to show that there is no agreement in the first place is admissible- Thus, unless the grounds fall within the provisos read with the illustrations to section 92, there is a bar on adducing oral evidence. (Para 18.2)  
**Judgment** \- A judgment should be coherent, systematic, and logically organised. It should enable the reader to trace the facts to a logical conclusion on the basis of legal principles. (Para 3\)  
**Pleading** \- The effort of pleading and evidence should be to be concise to the cause and must not confuse the cause. The lengthy pleadings and avoidable evidence are well within the scrutiny of trial courts, and, at the right stage, must be regulated within four corners of the law. Such an approach by trial courts would like a stitch in time, save nine. Long and drawn-out pleadings will run the risk of having a cascading effect on the appellate and revisional courts. Meandering pleadings will land up with laden weight in SLPs, making the narrative difficult. The time has come for courts to invoke the jurisdiction under Order 6 Rule 16 and make litigation workable. Courts are also confronted with AI-generated or computer-generated statements. While technology is useful in enhancing efficiency and efficacy, the placid pleadings will disorient the cause in a case. It is time that the approach to pleadings is re-invented and re-introduced to be brief and precise. (Para 3\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order XII Rule 6 \-** The words “or otherwise” are wide enough to include all cases of admissions made in the pleadings or de hors the pleadings i.e. either in any document or even in the statement recorded in the Court. If one of the parties' statement is recorded under O. 10, Rr. 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the same is also a statement which elucidates matters in controversy. Any admission in such statement is relevant not only for the purpose of finding out the real dispute between the parties but also to ascertain as to whether or not any dispute or controversy exists between the parties. Admission if any is made by a party in the statement recorded, would be conclusive against him and the Court can proceed to pass judgment on the basis of the admission made therein. (Para 35-37)

**Motor Vehicles Act 1988 \- Haryana Compassionate Assistance to the Dependents of Deceased Government Employees Rules, 2006- Motor Accident Compensation** \- Quoted from Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Shashi Sharma: A just compensation payable under the Act of 1988, therefore, is to exclude the amount received or receivable by the dependents of the deceased Government employee under the Rules of 2006 towards the head financial assistance equivalent to “pay and other allowances” that was last drawn by the deceased Government employee in the normal course. This is not to say that the amount or payment receivable by the dependents of the deceased Government employee under Rule 5 (1) of the Rules, is the total entitlement under the head of “loss of income”. So far as the claim towards loss of future escalation of income and other benefits, if the deceased Government employee had survived the accident can still be pursued by them in their claim under the Act of 1988\. For, it is not covered by the Rules of 2006\. (Para 5\)

**Service Law \- Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 \-** The benefit of extension of retirement age as provided under the OM dated 9.03.2013 could not have been confined to visually impaired category. Rather, it should be available to persons suffering from all such benchmark disabilities as are specified in the 1995 Act and the 2016 Act. No intelligible basis to confer benefit of age extension to one disabled category and deny it to the other when both are specified in the 1995 Act as well as the 2016 Act. In this view of the matter, if benefit of extension of retirement age is available to visually impaired category, the same ought to be available to other categories of disabilities specified in the 1995 Act as reiterated in the 2016 Act. (Para 14\)  
**Service Law** \- An employee has no fundamental right as regards the age at which he would retire. Moreover, termination of service of an employee on account of reaching the age of superannuation in accordance with law or rules regulating the conditions of service does not amount to his removal from service within the meaning of Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India.

**Indian Contract Act, 1872 \- Section 28 \-** Section 28 of the Contract Act does not bar exclusive jurisdiction clauses. What has been barred is the absolute restriction of any party from approaching a legal forum. The right to legal adjudication cannot be taken away from any party through contract but can be relegated to a set of Courts for the ease of the parties. (Para 29\) For an exclusive jurisdiction clause to be valid, it should be (a) in consonance with Section 28 of the Contract Act, i.e., it should not absolutely restrict any party from initiating legal proceedings pertaining to the contract, (b) the Court that has been given exclusive jurisdiction must be competent to have such jurisdiction in the first place, i.e., a Court not having jurisdiction as per the statutory regime cannot be bestowed jurisdiction by means of a contract and, finally, (c) the parties must either impliedly or explicitly confer jurisdiction on a specific set of courts. These three limbs/criteria have to be mandatorily fulfilled. (Para 18\) **Private Sector Employment** \- It may not be possible for all employers in the private sector to contest suits at far-off places from the registered office. This seems to be the overwhelming reason why exclusion clauses are inserted. (Para 22\)  
**Government Service and Private Sector** \- The origin of government service is contractual. There is an offer and acceptance in every case. But once appointed to his post or office, the government servant acquires a status and his rights and obligations are no longer determined by the consent of both the parties, but by the statute or statutory rules as framed. In other words, the legal position of a government servant is more one of status than that of contract. A government servant may not be tied down by his employer to a court at a particular place, should a dispute arise for adjudication by a law court. Articles 14, 16 and 21 could stand in the way- On the other hand, service in the private sector is governed by the terms of the employment contract entered into by and between the parties inter-se. Like any other contract, even in an employment contract, a concluded contract pre- supposes the existence of at least two parties with mutual rights and obligations. Once a concluded contract comes into existence, it is axiomatic that such rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the terms and conditions thereof. (Para 21\)  
**Contracts** \- A contract – be it commercial, insurance, sales, service, etc. – is after all a contract. It is a legally binding agreement, regardless of the parties involved or their inter se strengths- Law treats all contracts with equal respect and unless a contract is proved to suffer from any of the vitiating factors, the terms and conditions have to be enforced regardless of the relative strengths and weakness of the parties- Contracts should be treated equally, without bias or distinction. The fact that one party is more powerful or influential (the mighty lion) and the other more vulnerable (the timid rabbit) does not justify making exceptions or distinctions in the application of contractual principles.

**Uttar Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2008 \- Section 13** \- Section 13(1) provides for allowing credit of an amount as input tax credit to the extent provided by or under the relevant clause to which the applicable condition is attracted. If the purchased goods are resold in the course of exporting the goods out of India, then the full amount of input tax credit can be claimed. Section 13(7) outlines the circumstances under which such a benefit cannot be allowed. Section 13(7) also sets out that no facility for input tax credit shall be allowed to a dealer with respect to the purchase of any goods where the sale of such goods by the dealer is exempt from tax under Section 7(c) of the Act. The prohibition from allowing input tax credit is a statutory mandate. (Para 10\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 438, 82 \-** When after the investigation, a chargesheet is submitted in the court, or in a complaint case, summons or warrant is issued to the accused, he is bound to submit himself to the authority of law. If he is creating hindrances in the execution of warrants or is concealing himself and does not submit to the authority of law, he must not be granted the privilege of anticipatory bail, particularly when the Court taking cognizance has found him prima facie involved in serious economic offences or heinous offences. In such cases when the court has reason to believe that the person against whom the warrant has been issued has absconded or is concealing himself so that warrant could not be executed, the concerned court would be perfectly justified in initiating the proclamation proceedings against him under Section 82 Cr.P.C. The High Courts should also consider the factum of issuance of non-bailable warrants and initiation of proclamation proceedings seriously and not casually, while considering the anticipatory bail application of such accused. (Para 23\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 204 \-** Whether the attendance of the accused can be best secured by issuing a bailable warrant or non-bailable warrant, would be a matter, which entirely rests at the discretion of the concerned Court. Although the discretion should be exercised judiciously, diverse considerations such as the nature and seriousness of the offence, the circumstances peculiar to the accused, possibility of his concealing or absconding, larger interest of public and state etc. also must be seriously considered by the court- There cannot be a strait jacket formula that the Court must first issue a summons even in case of a warrant case, irrespective of the gravity or seriousness of the offence. (Para 28\)  
**Companies Act 2013 \- Section 212,447** \- The offence covered under Section 447 of the Companies Act has been made cognizable and the person accused of the said offence is not entitled to be released on bail or on his bond, unless twin conditions mentioned therein are satisfied. The twin conditions are: \- (i) that a Public Prosecutor should be given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release; and (ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. These twin conditions are mandatory in nature. (Para 24\)  
**Economic Offences** \-Economic offences constitute a class apart, as they have deep rooted conspiracies involving huge loss of public funds, and therefore such offences need to be viewed seriously. They are considered as grave and serious offences affecting the economy of the country as a whole and thereby posing serious threats to the financial health of the country. (Para 23\)  
**Quotable Quotes-** The law aids only the abiding and certainly not its resistants. (Para 23\) The judicial time of every court, even of Magistrate’s Court is as precious and valuable as that of the High Courts and the Supreme Court. The accused are duty bound to cooperate the trial courts in proceeding further with the cases and bound to remain present in the Court as and when required by the Court. Not allowing the Courts to proceed further with the cases by avoiding execution of summons or warrants, disobeying the orders of the Court, and trying to delay the proceedings by hook or crook, would certainly amount to interfering with and causing obstruction in the administration of justice. (Para 27\) If the Rule of Law is to prevail in the society, every person would have to abide by the law, respect the law and follow the due process of law. (Para 27\)

### [**R. Nagaraj (D) vs Rajmani 2025 INSC 478 \- CPC \- Framing of Issues \- Limitation**](https://www.caseciter.com/r-nagaraj-d-vs-rajmani/)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908** \- **Framing of Issues \-** There could be several points directly or indirectly connected with the main issue that has been framed. In such cases, when the larger issue that has been framed is wide enough to cover different points of disputes within it, there is no necessity to frame a specific issue on that aspect. Further, when the parties go to trial with the knowledge that a particular point is at lis, had full opportunity to let in evidence, they cannot later turn back to say that a specific issue was not framed. All that is required under law, is for the Court to render a finding on the particular fact or law in dispute, on the facts of the case \- Such evidence, in the absence of pleadings, cannot permit either of the parties to make out a new case- The Courts are vested with powers to go into the question of law, touching upon either the limitation or the jurisdiction, even if no plea is raised and not in cases, where facts have to be pleaded and evidence has to be let in. (Para 21\)

**Limitation** \- Limitation, as we generally know is a mixed question of fact and law. However, there is no hard and fast rule that every question of limitation is to be treated as a mixed question of fact and law. In cases, where the action is initiated after several years after the right to sue accrued, without any pleadings to explain the reasons for delay or as to when the fraud was discovered, the question of limitation is to be treated as a question of law- In cases, where the pleadings are silent, then it becomes the duty of the Court to ascertain from the evidence and the overall facts of the case, as pleaded by either party, and to render a finding on limitation where the question of limitation is to be treated as a question of law, since the Court cannot entertain frivolous or stale claims. (Para 20\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 100** \-High Court possesses the authority to entertain second appeals strictly on substantial questions of law. Upon admitting such an appeal, the High Court is empowered to frame substantial questions and adjudicate them directly, without the necessity of remanding the matter to the trial court. This approach ensures judicial efficiency and prevents unnecessary prolongation of litigation. (Para 12.1)

**Practice and Procedure** \- A question of law can be raised at any stage. (Para 20\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Limitation Act 1961** \- Civil Procedure Code and the law of limitation, being procedural laws, meant to assist the Courts in the process of rendering justice, cannot curtail the power of the Courts to render justice. Procedural laws after all are handmaid of justice. What is to be seen is whether any irregularity arising from a failure to follow procedure has caused serious prejudice to the parties. It is not to be forgotten that the process of adjudication is to discern the truth. (Para 20\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 21 \-** The right to shelter is also an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. This right can be taken away only by following due process of law. Moreover, our country is governed by the rule of law, which is an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The residential structures of citizens cannot be demolished in such a summary manner without following the principles of natural justice. \[**Context**: While setting aside Allahabad HC order in a demolition matter, SC observed: Carrying out demolition of residential structures in such a high- handed manner shows insensitivity on the part of the statutory development authority. This is one more case of bulldozer justice. The officers of the PDA have forgotten that the rule of law prevails in our country. Unfortunately, the State Government has supported the PDA.\]

**Uttar Pradesh Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973 \-Section 43-** If a person to whom the document is addressed is not found, it shall be affixed on some conspicuous part of his last known place of residence or business, or it should be tendered to some adult member of his family. There is also an option provided to send the document by registered post. Clause (d)(2) uses the words “if such person cannot be found”. The words are not “if such a person is not found”. It is clear that only after genuine multiple efforts are made to find the person on more than one day, one can say that “the person cannot be found”. It cannot be that the person entrusted with the job of serving notice goes to the address and affixes it after finding that on that day, the person concerned is unavailable at a given time. The words “if such a person cannot be found” cannot be given any other interpretation- Repeated efforts have to be made to effect personal service. Only if those efforts fail, can the other two options be resorted to. One is of affixing and the second is of sending by registered post. Considering the drastic consequences provided in Section 27, recourse should usually be taken to both modes. The officers of the PDA must understand that before a structure is demolished, every possible effort should be made to effect a proper service of the show-cause notice.

**Constitution of India \- Article 200,201 \-** The scheme of Article 200 does not envisage either the exercise of a pocket or an absolute veto by the Governor**\-** Governor can neither permanently keep a bill with him without according assent to it, nor can he declare a simpliciter withholding of assent \- **Options available to a State Governor when a bill passed by the State Legislature is presented for assent-** When a bill passed by the State legislature is presented to the Governor, the Governor has three options: (i) to give assent to the bill, (ii) to withhold assent from the bill, or (iii) to reserve the bill for the consideration of the President \-If the Governor decides to withhold assent, the first proviso to Article 200 mandates that the Governor must, as soon as possible after the presentation of the bill, return the bill to the House or Houses of the Legislature with a message requesting that the House or Houses reconsider the bill or any specified provisions thereof, and in particular, consider the desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may recommend in his message- Once a bill is returned by the Governor and is reconsidered and repassed by the State Legislature without material changes, the first proviso to Article 200 clearly states that the Governor "shall not withhold assent therefrom." The only exception is if the repassed bill is materially different from the bill originally presented. In the case discussed, the reservation of the bills for the President in the second round was deemed illegal-  **Timelines prescribed**: (i) For withholding assent or reserving a bill (upon the aid and advice of the State Council of Ministers): forthwith, subject to a maximum of one month. (ii) For returning a bill after withholding assent contrary to the advice of the State Council of Ministers: maximum of three months. (iii) For reserving a bill contrary to the advice of the State Council of Ministers: maximum of three months. (iv) For granting assent to a bill presented after reconsideration: forthwith, subject to a maximum of one month. (v) For the President to take a decision on reserved bills: within a period of three months from the date of receipt. Delays beyond this require recorded reasons to be conveyed to the State . (Para 434\) \- Delay caused by the Governor beyond the prescribed time-limits would be justiciable and the courts, with deference to applicable judicial principles, would be fully competent to ascertain whether the delayed exercise of power by the Governor under Article 200 was based on any reasonable grounds or not. (Para 244\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 200,201-**  a. Where the bill which is under consideration is pertaining to a provision of the Constitution where primacy has been given to the Union government in taking a decision keeping in consideration the desirability of having certain uniform standards of national policy, then the limited grounds of judicial review would be based on arbitrariness, malafides, etc. b. Where the bill which is under consideration pertains to a subject matter or domain within which State legislature has been accorded primacy, and the reservation of the bill is by the Governor contrary to the aid and advice of the State Council of Ministers, then in exercise of judicial review the courts would be competent to look into the reasons for withholding of assent and whether they are legally tenable or not, besides the grounds of malafides and arbitrariness, etc. 369\. We clarify that the possible situations illustrated by above are not meant to be exhaustive and in the specific facts of a given case, the courts may evolve new standards of judicial scrutiny to ensure that the constitutionally prescribed procedure is adhered to in letter and spirit. (Para 368-369)

**Constitution of India \- Article 200,201-**There is no ‘pocket veto’ or ‘absolute veto’ available to the President in discharge of his functions under Article 201\. The use of the expression “shall declare” makes it mandatory for the President to make a choice between the two options available under the substantive part of Article 201, that is, to either grant assent or to withhold assent to a bill. The constitutional scheme does not, in any manner, provide that a constitutional authority can exercise its powers under the Constitution arbitrarily. This necessarily implies that the withholding of assent under Article 201 is to be accompanied by the furnishing of reasons for such withholding. (Para 434-XVIII)

**Constitution of India \- Article 32,226, 200,201- Judicial Review \-** judicial review of the exercise of power by the Governor under Article 200 and the exercise of power by the President under Article 201 \- a. Where the Governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President in his own discretion and contrary to the aid and advice tendered to him by the State Council of Ministers, it shall be open to the State Government to assail such an action before the appropriate High Court or this Court. Such a challenge can broadly be made on the following grounds: (i) Where the reservation is on the ground that the bill is of a description falling under the Second Proviso to Article 200 of the Constitution, it may be assailed on the ground that the bill or any provision thereof does not so derogate from the powers of the High Court so as to endanger the position which that court is designed by the Constitution to fill. The Governor while reserving a bill on this count shall be expected to provide clear reasons and also point to the specific provision(s) of the bill which, in his opinion, attract the Second Proviso. This question being purely of a legal nature would be completely justiciable and the competent court would be, after a proper adjudication, fully authorized to approve or disapprove of such reservation by the Governor. If such a challenge finds favour with the competent court, then, subject to any other considerations, it would be a fit case for the issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus to the Governor for appropriate action. If, however, the challenge should fail then the mechanism envisaged under Article 201 of the Constitution will spring into action. (ii) Where the reservation is on account of the bill attracting any provision of the Constitution wherein the assent of the President is a condition precedent for the proper enactment and enforceability of such a bill as a law (such as under Article 364A2) or for the purpose of securing any immunity (such as under Article 31A) or overcoming any repugnancy that may exist qua a Central Legislation (under Article 254(2)), then the Governor is expected to make a specific and clear reference to the President properly indicating the reasons for such reservation and inviting his attention as described in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra). Such a reservation can be assailed by the State Government, if the reference made by the Governor either fails to indicate the reasons for such reservation as discussed above or that the reasons indicated are wholly irrelevant, mala- fide, arbitrary, unnecessary or motivated by extraneous considerations. Then such a reservation would be liable to be set aside. This question being purely of a legal nature would be completely justiciable and the competent court would be after a proper adjudication fully authorized to approve or disapprove of such reservation by the Governor. If such a challenge finds favour with the competent court, then, subject to any other considerations, it would be fit case for issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus to the Governor for appropriate action. If however, the challenge should fail then the mechanism envisaged under Article 201 of the Constitution will spring into action. (iii) Where the reservation of a bill by the Governor for the consideration of the President is on the grounds of peril to democracy or democratic principles or on other exceptional grounds as mentioned in M.P. Special Police (supra) and Nabam Rebia (supra) then the Governor would be expected to make a specific and clear reference to the President properly indicating the reasons for entertaining such a belief by pinpointing the specific provisions in this regard and the consequent effect that may ensue if such a bill were to be allowed to become a law. The Governor while making such a reference should also indicate his subjective satisfaction as to why the aforesaid consequences that may ensue cannot be possibly curtailed or contained by taking recourse to the constitutional courts of the country. It shall be open to the State Government to challenge such a reservation on the ground of failure on part of the Governor to furnish the necessary reasons as discussed aforesaid or that the reasons indicated are wholly irrelevant, mala-fide, arbitrary, unnecessary or motivated by extraneous considerations. This being a question completely capable of being determined by the constitutional courts, would be fully justiciable. (iv) Reservation of a bill on grounds other than the ones mentioned above, such as personal dissatisfaction of the Governor, political expediency or any other extraneous or irrelevant considerations is strictly impermissible by the Constitution and would be liable to be set-aside forthwith on that ground alone. This will also encompass reservation of a bill by the Governor after having already exercised the option of withholding of assent in terms of Article 200 except in such exceptional circumstance as mentioned in paragraph 204 of this judgment. (v) Where the Governor exhibits inaction in making a decision when a bill is presented to him for assent under Article 200 and such inaction exceeds the time-limit as has been prescribed by us in paragraph 250 of this judgment then it shall be open to the State Government to seek a writ of mandamus from a competent court against the Governor directing expeditious decision on the concerned bill as is the mandate of the Constitution, however, it is clarified that the Governor may successfully resist such a challenge on providing sufficient explanation for the delay caused \- **Where the Governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President and the President in turn withholds assent thereto then, it shall be open to the State Government to assail such an action before this Court. Such a challenge can broadly be made on the following grounds:** Where the Governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President and the President in turn withholds assent thereto then, it shall be open to the State Government to assail such an action before this Court. Such a challenge can broadly be made on the following grounds: (i) Where a State bill has been reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the President on the ground that assent of the President is required for the purpose of making the bill enforceable or securing some immunity therefor, then in such cases the withholding of assent by the President would be justiciable to the limited extent of exercise of such power in an arbitrary or malafide manner. Owing to the political nature of the assent of the President in these categories of bills, the courts would impose a self-restraint. (ii) Where a State bill has been reserved by the Governor, in his discretion, for the consideration of the President on the ground that the bill appears to be patently unconstitutional for placing the principles of representative democracy in peril, the withholding of assent by the President would, in ordinary circumstances, involve purely legal and constitutional questions and therefore be justiciable without any impediments imposed by the doctrine of political thicket. In such cases, it would be prudent for the President to obtain the advisory opinion of this Court by way of a reference under Article 143 and act in accordance with the same to dispel any apprehensions of bias, arbitrariness or mala fides. (iii) Where the President exhibits inaction in making a decision when a bill is presented to him for assent under Article 201 and such inaction exceeds the time-limit as has been prescribed by us in paragraph 391 of this judgment then it shall be open to the State Government to seek a writ of mandamus from this Court. (Para 434-XXIV)

**Constitution of India \- Article 200 \-** Governor does not possess any discretion in the exercise of his functions under Article 200 and has to mandatorily abide by the advice tendered to him by the Council of Ministers- There are two broad circumstances under which it would be permissible for the Governor to act in his own discretion under Article 200: a. Where the Governor is by or under the Constitution required to act in his discretion. The only situation in which such exercise of discretion has been explicitly laid down in the Constitution is the second proviso to Article 200, that is, where, in the opinion of the Governor, the bill, if assented to, would so derogate from the powers of the High Court as to endanger the position which the High Court is designed to fill by the Constitution; b. Where the Governor is by necessary implication required to act in his own discretion. This would include: (i) Where a bill attracts such a provision of the Constitution which requires the mandatory assent of the President for securing immunity or making the law enforceable. Exercise of discretion is permissible in these cases. For instance, Article(s) 31A, 31C, 254(2), 288(2), 360(4)(a)(ii) etc. (ii) Situations where the exceptional conditions as described in M.P. Special Police (supra) and Nabam Rebia (supra) are applicable i.e., the State Council of Ministers has disabled or disentitled itself; possibility of complete breakdown of the rule of law or by reason of peril to democracy/democratic principles respectively, as a consequence of which an action may be compelled which, by its nature is not amenable to ministerial advice. (Para 318-320)

**Pre-legislation consultation \-**States should enter into pre-legislation consultation with the Central government before introducing legislations on matters pertaining to those provisions of the Constitution where the assent of the President may be required. Likewise, the Central government, should consider the legislative proposals sent by the State governments with due regard and expediency. Such a practice reduces friction between Centre- State relations and also ensures that future roadblocks are overcome in the beginning itself, thereby promoting public welfare. (Para 425\)

**Quotable Quotes-** We take this opportunity to quote Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s concluding speech in the Constituent Assembly, which is as relevant today as it was in 1949 – “However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot. (Para 439\) It is only when the constitutional functionaries exercise their powers by and under the Constitution that they show deference to the people of India who have given the Constitution to themselves. (Para 440\) The soul of India is its Constitution. Our Republic, the foresight of dynamic visionaries. What a great edifice, they built, ensuring sovereignty with democratic values. The Constitution is our bedrock ensuring our safety and security. It outlines a process that keeps us rooted in values. We read it for reference and for every policy decision. Without it, we would be lost and make many mistakes. It is now seventy-five years old, but we still keep turning to it, why? Because it guarantees our rights and sets benchmarks for our responsibilities. The laws and rules that uplift all people sprout from its pristine womb, welfare of all is its primary concern, but its sanctity and safety should be our prime concern. (Para 441\)

**Broad Principles for Grant of Bail \-** Referred to various precedents- The sacrosanctity of liberty is paramount in a civilised society. However, in a democratic body polity which is wedded to the rule of law an individual is expected to grow within the social restrictions sanctioned by law. The individual liberty is restricted by larger social interest and its deprivation must have due sanction of law. In an orderly society an individual is expected to live with dignity having respect for law and also giving due respect to others' rights. It is a well-accepted principle that the concept of liberty is not in the realm of absolutism but is a restricted one. The cry of the collective for justice, its desire for peace and harmony and its necessity for security cannot be allowed to be trivialised. The life of an individual living in a society governed by the rule of law has to be regulated and such regulations which are the source in law subserve the social balance and function as a significant instrument for protection of human rights and security of the collective. This is because, fundamentally, laws are made for their obedience so that every member of the society lives peacefully in a society to achieve his individual as well as social interest. (Para 62\) The true test to ascertain whether discretion has been judiciously exercised or not is to see whether the court has been able to strike a balance between the personal liberty of the accused and the interest of the State, in other words, the societal interests. Each bail application should be decided in the facts and circumstances of the case having regard to the various factors germane to the well settled principles of grant or refusal of bail. (Para 78\)  
**Child Trafficking \-** We want to convey a message to one & all more particularly the parents across the country that they should remain extremely vigilant and careful with their children. A slight carelessness or negligence or laxity on their part may prove to be extremely costly. The pain and agony which any parents may have to face when the child dies is different from the pain and agony that the parents may have to face when they lose their children to such gangs engaged in trafficking. When the child dies, the parents may with passage of time resign to the will of the Almighty but when the child is lost and not found they have to suffer the pain and agony for the rest of their life. It is worst than death. Therefore, we humbly urge to one and all to remain very cautious and vigilant- If any newborn infant is trafficked from any hospital, the immediate action against the hospital should be suspension of licence to run the hospital over and above other actions in accordance with law. When any lady comes to deliver her baby in any hospital, it is the responsibility of the administration of the hospital to protect the newborn infant in all respects. (Para 90-91)

**Copyright Act \- Section 15(2) ; Designs Act \-** There may be some designs that could be entitled to copyright protection, and conversely, there can be certain artistic works which lose their copyright protection when industrially applied (Para 17)- The original artistic work, which initially enjoys copyright protection, does not lose the same merely because a ‘design’ derived from it has been industrially applied to create a product. While the expression ‘artistic work’ has a broad spectrum, ‘design’ is restricted to specific features such as shape, configuration, pattern, ornamentation, or composition of lines or colours, applied to an article through an industrial process, resulting in a finished product that appeals to the eye. These visually appealing features, when applied industrially, define a ‘design’ under the Designs Act. (Para 58)- Two-pronged approach in order to ascertain whether a work is qualified to be protected by the Designs Act. This test shall consider: (i) whether the work in question is purely an ‘artistic work’ entitled to protection under the Copyright Act or whether it is a ‘design’ derived from such original artistic work and subjected to an industrial process based upon the language in Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act; (ii) if such a work does not qualify for copyright protection, then the test of ‘functional utility’ will have to be applied so as to determine its dominant purpose, and then ascertain whether it would qualify for design protection under the Design Act.The courts, while applying this test, ought to undertake a case- specific inquiry guided by statutory provisions, judicial precedents, and comparative jurisprudence. It must be kept in mind that the overarching objective is to ensure that rights granted under either regime serve their intended purpose without unduly encroaching upon the domain of the other.(Para 60-61)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Order VII Rule 11 ; Copyright Act ; Designs Act \-** The question as to whether the original artistic work would fall within the meaning of ‘design’ under the Designs Act cannot be answered while deciding an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. This stage would involve only a prima facie inquiry as to the disclosure of cause of action in the plaint. The question pertaining to ascertaining the true nature of the ‘Proprietary Engineering Drawings’ involves a mixed question of law and fact and could not have been decided by the Commercial Court at a preliminary stage based upon such a casual appraisal of the plaint averments.

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** The rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of an alternative remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of compulsion. There can be many contingencies in which the High Court may be justified in exercising its writ jurisdiction inspite of availability of an alternative remedy. (Para 11\) The constitutional powers vested in the High Court or the Supreme Court cannot be fettered by any alternative remedy available to the party concerned. Injustice, whenever and wherever it takes place, should be struck down as an anathema to the rule of law and the provisions of the Constitution. (Para 12\) \[Allowing appeal against HC judgment, Supreme Court directed Maharashtra Police Dept. to handover vacant and peaceful possession of flats belonging to appellants along with the arrears of rent accrued till the date of handing over of the possession of the two flats and observed: The High Court should have kept the year in mind i.e. 1940\. This country was ruled by the Britishers. The country was fighting hard to seek independence from the Britishers. Bombay in the year 1940 was altogether different. At the relevant point of time, the Department perhaps might have persuaded the appellants or their predecessors in title to part with the possession of the two flats for the Police Department. However, it has been now 84 years that the Police Department has been in occupation and use of the two flats. Look at the conduct of the Department. We are informed that past eighteen years even rent has not been paid.\]

**Limitation Act 1961- Section 3 \-** Every suit instituted after the period prescribed under the Act shall be dismissed even if limitation has not been set up as a defence. The aforesaid provision is of a mandatory nature and cannot be ignored by the courts even if not pleaded or argued by the defence. It is obligatory upon the court to dismiss the suit if it is, on the face of it, barred by limitation. The aforesaid provision has been enacted for public good and to give quietus to a remedy after lapse of a particular period, as a matter of public policy, though without extinguishing the right in certain cases. Therefore, once a limitation prescribed for instituting a cause of action expires and even if limitation is not set up as a defence, it obliges the court to dismiss the suit as barred by limitation. (Para 26\) When suit is ex-facie barred by limitation, no evidence is required to be adduced by the parties. (Para 27\)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order VII Rule 11 \-** When the other reliefs are dependent upon the first relief and cannot be granted until and unless the plaintiff succeeds in the first relief, once the plaint or the suit in respect of the main relief stands barred by time, the other ancillary relief claimed therein also falls down.

**Constitution of India \- Schedule VIII \- Maharashtra Local Authorities (Official Languages) Act, 2022 \-** There is no prohibition on the use of Urdu under the 2022 Act or in any provision of law- If people or a group of people, residing within the area covered by the Municipal Council are familiar with Urdu, then there should not be any objection if Urdu is used in addition to the official language i.e. Marathi, at least on the signboard of the Municipal Council. Language is a medium for exchange of ideas that brings people holding diverse views and beliefs closer and it should not become a cause of their division. (Para 46\) \- The use of language for official purposes is not according to any rigid formula. (Para 40\) \- Marathi and Urdu occupy the same position under Schedule VIII of the Constitution of India (Para 15\)

**Language \-** Language is not religion. Language does not even represent religion. Language belongs to a community, to a region, to people; and not to a religion- Language is culture. Language is the yardstick to measure the civilizational march of a community and its people.(Para 17 \-18) We must respect and rejoice in our diversity, including our many languages. India has more than hundred major languages (Para 20\) **Urdu** \- Urdu, like Marathi and Hindi, is an Indo-Aryan language. It is a language which was born in this land. Urdu developed and flourished in India due to the need for people belonging to different cultural milieus who wanted to exchange ideas and communicate amongst themselves. Over the centuries, it attained ever greater refinement and became the language of choice for many acclaimed poets. (Para 27\) Even today, the language used by the common people of the country is replete with words of the Urdu language, even if one is not aware of it. It would not be incorrect to say that one cannot have a day-to-day conversation in Hindi without using words of Urdu or words derived from Urdu. The word ‘Hindi’ itself comes from the Persian word ‘Hindavi’\! This exchange of vocabulary flows both ways because Urdu also has many words borrowed from other Indian languages, including Sanskrit. (Para 37\) Urdu words have a heavy influence on Court parlance, both in criminal and civil law. From Adalat to halafnama to peshi, the influence of Urdu is writ large in the language of the Indian Courts. For that matter, even though the official language of the Supreme Court and the High Courts as per Article 348 of the Constitution is English, yet many Urdu words continue to be used in this Court till date. These include vakalatnama, dasti, etc. (Para 38\) \- When we criticize Urdu, we are in a way also criticizing Hindi, as according to linguists and literary scholars, Urdu and Hindi are not two languages, but it is one language. True, Urdu is mainly written in Nastaliq and Hindi in Devnagri; but then scripts do not make a language. What makes languages distinct is their syntax, their grammar and their phonology. Urdu and Hindi have broad similarities in all these counts. (Para 41\)

**Civil Suits \- Income Tax Act 1961 \- Section 269ST \-**(A) Whenever, a suit is filed with a claim that Rs. 2,00,000/- and above is paid by cash towards any transaction, the courts must intimate the same to the jurisdictional Income Tax Department to verify the transaction and the violation of Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, if any, (B) Whenever, any such information is received either from the court or otherwise, the Jurisdictional Income Tax authority shall take appropriate steps by following the due process in law, (C) Whenever, a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- and above is claimed to be paid by cash towards consideration for conveyance of any immovable property in a document presented for registration, the jurisdictional Sub-Registrar shall intimate the same to the jurisdictional Income Tax Authority who shall follow the due process in law before taking any action, (D) Whenever, it comes to the knowledge of any Income Tax Authority that a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- or above has been paid by way of consideration in any transaction relating to any immovable property from any other source or during the course of search or assessment proceedings, the failure of the registering authority shall be brought to the knowledge of the Chief Secretary of the State/UT for initiating appropriate disciplinary action against such officer who failed to intimate the transactions.  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order VII Rule 11 \-**Order VII Rule 11 CPC serves as a crucial filter in civil litigation, enabling courts to terminate proceedings at the threshold where the plaintiff's case, even if accepted in its entirety, fails to disclose any cause of action or is barred by law, either express or by implication \- There is a bounden duty on the Court to discern and identify fictitious suit, which on the face of it would be barred, but for the clever pleadings disclosing a cause of action, that is surreal. Generally, sub-clauses (a) and (d) are stand alone grounds, that can be raised by the defendant in a suit. However, it cannot be ruled out that under certain circumstances, clauses (a) and (d) can be mutually inclusive. For instances, when clever drafting veils the implied bar to disclose the cause of action; it then becomes the duty of the Court to lift the veil and expose the bar to reject the suit at the threshold. The power to reject a plaint under this provision is not merely procedural but substantive, aimed at preventing abuse of the judicial process and ensuring that court time is not wasted on fictitious claims failing to disclose any cause of action to sustain the suit or barred by law. (Para 14.1) \- Only averments in the plaint are to be considered under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. While it is true that the defendant's defense is not to be considered at this stage, this does not mean that the court must accept patently untenable claims or shut its eyes to settled principles of law and put the parties to trial, even in cases which are barred and the cause of action is fictitious. (Para 17\) When the defects go to the root of the case, barred by law with fictitious allegations and are incurable, no amount of evidence can salvage the case (Para 16\) Merely including a paragraph on cause of action is not sufficient but rather, on a meaningful reading of the plaint and the documents, it must disclose a cause of action. The plaint should contain such cause of action that discloses all the necessary facts required in law to sustain the suit and not mere statements of fact which fail to disclose a legal right of the plaintiff to sue and breach or violation by the defendant(s). It is pertinent to note here that even if a right is found, unless there is a violation or breach of that right by the defendant, the cause of action should be deemed to be unreal. This is where the substantive laws like Specific Relief Act, 1963, Contract Act, 1872, and Transfer of Property Act, 1882, come into operation. A pure question of law that can be decided at the early stage of litigation, ought to be decided at the earliest stage. In the present case, the respondents' claim based on an agreement to sell. (Para 15\)  
**Transfer Of Property Act 1882 \- Section 53A,54 \-** An agreement to sell does not confer any right on the proposed purchaser under the agreement. Therefore, as a natural corollary, any right, until the sale deed is executed, will vest only with the owner, or in other words, the vendor to take necessary action to protect his interest in the property (Para 15.2.1) \- Though an agreement to sell creates certain rights, these rights are purely personal between the parties to the agreement and can only be enforced against the vendors or, in limited circumstances, under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, against a subsequent transferee with notice \- They cannot be enforced against third parties who claim independent title and possession.  
**Transfer Of Property Act 1882 \- Section 53A** \- The applicability of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is subject to certain conditions viz., (a) the agreement must be in writing with the owner of the property or in other words, the transferor must be either the owner or his authorised representative, (b) the transferee must have been put into possession or must have acted in furtherance of the agreement and made some developments, (c) the protection under Section 53-A is not an exemption to Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or in other words, a transferee, put into possession with the knowledge of a pending lis, is not entitled to any protection, (d) the transferee must be in possession when the lis is initiated against his transferor and must be willing to perform the remaining part of his obligation, (e) the transferee must be entitled to seek specific performance or in other words, must not be barred by any of the provisions of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 from seeking such performance. The protection under Section 53-A is not available against a third party who may have an adversarial claim against the vendor. (Para 15.1)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 141 \-** Ratio laid down by Supreme court, is applicable irrespective of the stage at which it is relied upon. What is relevant is the ratio and not the stage. Such contentions go against the spirit of Article 141 of the Constitution of India. Once a ratio is laid down, the courts have to apply the ratio, considering the facts of the case and once, found to be applicable, irrespective of the stage, the same has to be applied, to throw out frivolous suits.

**NDPS Act** \- All the psychotropic substances mentioned under the Schedule to the Act have potential grave and harmful consequences to the individual and the society at large, when abused. Some psychotropic substances mentioned under the Schedule to the NDPS Act are also mentioned under the D\&C Act and the rules framed thereunder. This is only because those substances while capable of being abused for their inherent properties could also be used in the field of medicine. However, the mere mention of certain psychotropic substances under the D\&C regime would not take them away from the purview of the NDPS Act, if they are also mentioned under the Schedule to the NDPS Act \- It cannot be said that the dealing in of “Buprenorphine Hydrochloride” would not amount to an offence under Section 8 of the NDPS Act owing to the fact that the said psychotropic substance only finds mention under the Schedule to the NDPS Act and is not listed under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules.(Para 156-157)  
**Doctrine of Prospective Overruling \-** i. The default rule is that the overruling of a decision generally operates retrospectively. This is because a judgement which interprets a statute or provision declares the meaning of the statute as it should have been construed from the date of its enactment and what has been declared to be the law of the land must be held to have always been the law of the land. This rationale also stems from the Blackstonian rule that the duty of the court is not to “pronounce a new law but to maintain and expound the old one”. The judge rather than being the creator of the law, is only its discoverer. Therefore, if a subsequent decision alters or overrules the earlier one, it cannot be said to have made a new law. The correct principle of law is just discovered and applied retrospectively. ii. Since resorting to the doctrine of “prospective overruling” is an exception to the normal rule that a judgement or decision applies retrospectively and to the general rule of doctrine of precedent, an express declaration by the court that its decision is prospectively applicable is absolutely necessary. Prospectivity as a concept cannot be considered to be inhered in situations since the intention to attribute prospectivity to a decision must be limpid and clear. (iii) even if the overruling decision does not indicate that its decision is to apply with prospective effect, a different or even a smaller bench of this Court, subsequently, can declare that the doctrine of prospective overruling must be applied to the prior judgment of this Court, in exercise of the power under Article 142 to do complete justice to the matter at hand. (Para 122\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 216,227,228-** Once charges have been framed by the Trial Court in exercise of the powers under Section 228 CrPC, the accused cannot thereafter be discharged, be it through an exercise of the powers under Sections 227 or 216 CrPC- The language of Section 216 CrPC provides only for the addition and alteration of charge(s) and not for the deletion or discharge of an accused- Therefore, at such a stage of the trial, the accused must necessarily either be convicted or acquitted of the charges that were so framed against him. No shortcuts must be allowed. (Para 154\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 216-** Any Court is empowered to “alter” or “add” to any charge framed against the accused, at any time before the judgment is pronounced. Therefore, an outer time limit is set i.e. the power conferred upon the Courts cannot be exercised after a decision is pronounced in the matter. Although the provision does not expressly provide for the stage of the trial after which the power under Section 216 CrPC can be exercised, yet logic and rationale obviously requires it to be exercised after a charge has been framed by the Trial Court under Section 228 CrPC. For if no charge has been framed, there arises no occasion to add or alter it. As a natural corollary, if an accused has already been discharged under Section 227 CrPC, no application or action under Section 216 CrPC would be maintainable. (Para 143\) The Court may alter or add to any charge either upon its own motion or on an application by the parties concerned. Therefore, such a power can be invoked by the Court suo moto as well. This power under Section 216 CrPC is exclusive to the concerned Court and no party can seek such an addition or alteration of charge as a matter of right by filing an application. It would be the Trial Court which must decide whether a proper charge has been framed or not, at the appropriate stage of the trial. On a consideration of the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and documents adduced, the Trial Court must satisfy itself that the exercise of power under Section 216 is necessary. The provision has been enacted with the salutary object to ensure a fair and full trial to the accused person(s) in each case.(Para 144\) To alter a charge would be to vary an existing charge and make a different charge. Hence, when the Court exercises its power under Section 216, either on its own motion or on an application made by the parties, and “alters” a charge, it would be necessary that the existing charge be varied and a new charge be made. (Para 149\)

**Criminal Trial \- Motive \-** If the case is built solely upon circumstantial evidence, absence of motive will be a factor that weighs in favour of the accused. Just as a strong motive does not by itself result in a conviction, the absence of motive on that sole ground cannot result in an acquittal. When the eyewitnesses are not convincing, a strong motive cannot by itself result in conviction, likewise when the circumstances are very convincing and provide an unbroken chain leading only to the conclusion of guilt of the accused and not to any other hypothesis; the total absence of a motive will be of no consequence- Motive remains hidden in the inner recesses of the mind of the perpetrator, which cannot, oftener than ever, be ferreted out by the investigation agency. Though in a case of circumstantial evidence, the complete absence of motive would weigh in favour of the accused, it cannot be declared as a general proposition of universal application that, in the absence of motive, the entire inculpatory circumstances should be ignored and the accused acquitted.

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 11,21** \- A notice invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the ACA is mandatory as it fixes the date of commencement of arbitration, which is essential for determining limitation periods and the applicable law, and it is a prerequisite to filing an application under Section 11\. However, merely because such a notice was not issued to certain persons who are parties to the arbitration agreement does not denude the arbitral tribunal of its jurisdiction to implead them as parties during the arbitral proceedings. (Para 40\)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 11 \-** The purpose of an application under Section 11 is for the court to appoint an arbitrator, so as to enable dispute resolution through arbitration when the appointment procedure in the agreement fails. The court only undertakes a limited and prima facie examination into the existence of the arbitration agreement and its parties at this stage. Hence, merely because a court does not refer a certain party to arbitration in its order does not denude the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal from impleading them during the arbitral proceedings as the referral court’s view does not finally determine this issue. (Para 40\)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 7,16 \-**The relevant consideration to determine whether a person can be made a party before the arbitral tribunal is if such a person is a party to the arbitration agreement.

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 415-420** \- Merely on the allegation of failure to keep a promise will not be enough to initiate criminal proceedings. Thus, the dishonest intention on the part of the party who is alleged to have committed the offence of cheating should be established at the time of entering into the transaction with the complainant, otherwise the offence of cheating is not established or made out. It is the duty and obligation of the court to exercise a great deal of caution in issuing process, particularly when the matter is essentially of civil nature. The prevalent impression that civil remedies, being time-consuming, do not adequately protect the interests of creditors or lenders should be discouraged and rejected as criminal procedure cannot be used to apply pressure. Failure to do so results in the breakdown of the rule of law and amounts to misuse and abuse of the legal process \[Context: Supreme Court imposed costs of ₹50,000 on the State of Uttar Pradesh and observed: *we are being flooded with cases of civil wrongs being made the subject matter of criminal proceedings by filing chargesheets, etc.*\]

It follows therefore that if the appellant submits nothing for its consideration, the Appellate Court can decide the appeal without any reference to any proceedings of the courts below and, in doing so, it can simply say that the appellants have not urged anything which would tend to show that the judgment and decree under appeal were wrong.

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 34,37-** Lawyers' tendency to argue as if these proceedings were regular appeals \- They must show restraint \- The high monetary stakes involved in the proceedings should not result in unnecessarily long oral submissions or bulky written submissions. All this results in the criticism about the arbitrations in India. Therefore, there is a need to impose time limit on oral submissions in such cases. We cannot forget that this Court and the High Courts have the appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases. These Courts should be in a position to also devote sufficient time to the cases of the common man. (Para 57-58)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 34,37-** The powers of the Appellate Court under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act are not broader than those of the Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.

**Maharashtra Ownership Flats (Regulation of the Promotion of Construction, Sale, Management and Transfer Act) 1963- Section 11-** Quasi-judicial powers have been conferred on the competent authority while dealing with applications under Section 11(3) of the MOFA. However, proceedings before the competent authority under Section 11(3) are of a summary nature, as can be seen from the MOFA Rules. Therefore, the competent authority, while passing the final order, must record reasons- The competent authority, while following the summary procedure, cannot conclusively and finally decide the question of title. Therefore, notwithstanding the order under sub-section (4) of Section 11, the aggrieved parties can always maintain a civil suit for establishing their rights; The provisions of Section 11 are for the benefit of the flat purchasers- In writ jurisdiction, the Court should not interfere with the order granting deemed conveyance unless the same is manifestly illegal. The writ court should generally be slow in interfering with such orders. The reason is that, notwithstanding the order under Section 11(4), the remedy of aggrieved parties to file a civil suit remains open; and The registering officer has no power to sit in appeal over the order of the competent authority while exercising the power under Section 11(5). He can refuse registration only on the grounds indicated in paragraph 23 above and not beyond. Thus, the scope of the powers conferred on the registering officer is limited. (Para 37\)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 47** \- An objection as to executability of the decree can be raised but such objection is limited to the ground of jurisdictional infirmity or voidness- only a decree which is a nullity can be the subject matter of objection under Section 47 CPC and not one which is erroneous either in law or on facts.

When faced with Returns for different Assessment Years, it would be upto the Tribunal concerned to adopt either the average income therefrom or choose an Assessment Year to rely upon.

**Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 \- Motor Accident Compensation Claims \-** Till the rules are not framed, the High Courts shall either issue practice directions or formulate rules of procedure by incorporating the following provisions: a) While filing claim petitions under the 1988 Act, following particulars shall be incorporated: (i) Names and addresses (local and permanent) of the injured persons or the owners of the damaged property, as the case may be, their Aadhar and PAN details and email-id, if any; and (ii) Names and addresses (local and permanent) of all the legal representatives of the deceased victim of the accident who are claiming compensation, their Aadhar and PAN details and email-id, if any; (b) If the aforesaid details are not furnished, the registration of the application should not be refused on that ground, but MAC Tribunals at the time of issuing notice may direct the applicant(s) to furnish the information and make the issue of the notice subject to making compliance; (c) While passing an interim or final order of grant of compensation, the MAC Tribunals shall call upon the person or persons held entitled to receive compensation, to produce their bank account details along with either a certificate of the banker giving all details of the bank account of the person or persons entitled to receive the compensation including IFS Code, or a copy of a cancelled cheque of the bank account. The Tribunal shall call upon the claimants to produce the documents within a specified reasonable time; (d) A further direction shall be issued to the persons entitled to receive compensation to keep on updating information regarding the bank accounts, email id, in case there is any change; (e) In the event a consent award or consent order is made, the MAC Tribunals may direct the deposit of the compensation amount ordered to be released to the claimants directly to the bank accounts of the persons held entitled to receive compensation. However, the consent terms must contain all relevant account details of the persons entitled to compensation in accordance with clause (c) above. The account details can also be incorporated in the order passed for the disbursement of the amount on the basis of a compromise between the parties. In case of compromise before the Lok Adalats, the MAC Tribunal, on the basis of the settlement, shall pass a consequential order in the above terms; (f) It shall be the duty of the learned Judges presiding over the MAC Tribunal to verify from the certificate issued by the banker and ascertain whether the account is of the persons held entitled to receive compensation; (g) The MAC Tribunals, while passing orders of withdrawal/disbursement, shall, in the ordinary course, pass an order of transfer of the requisite amounts directly to the bank account of the person/s entitled to receive compensation as per the account details furnished. If there is a long gap between the date of furnishing the account details and the date of filing application for withdrawal of the amount, the Tribunal will be well advised to get fresh account details of the claimants; (h) Whenever the MAC Tribunal passes an order of deposit of compensation amount with the Tribunal, there shall be a direction issued to invest the amounts to be deposited in fixed deposit with any nationalised bank and the fixed deposit shall be with the standing instructions to the bank to renew the same after periodical intervals till further orders are passed by the Tribunal; (i) Similarly, practice directions/rules be framed in respect of adjudication made under the 1923 Act. The above directions issued while passing awards in claims under the 1988 Act shall be applied in case of the claims for compensation under the 1923 Act; (j) The Central Project Co-ordinator of e-court project or Registrar (Computer/IT) of the High Courts, as the case may be, with the help of the State Government, shall create a dashboard on which the information regarding the amounts lying deposited in connection with the compensation granted under 1988 or 1923 Acts shall be regularly uploaded with all details. It will help all concerned to implement the directions issued under this order; (k) All the High Courts shall issue administrative directions to the MAC Tribunals and Commissioners under the 1923 Act to initiate a massive drive to ascertain the whereabouts of the persons who have been held to be entitled to receive compensation, but have not taken the same. This shall be done by taking the assistance of the District and Taluka Legal Services Authorities and para-legal volunteers; (l) The State Governments shall provide assistance to the Legal Services Authorities of the local police officers/revenue officers of the district and taluka to trace the claimants who are held entitled to receive compensation; (m) The State Legal Services Authorities shall monitor compliance with the directions issued in terms of clauses (k) and (l) above and report compliance within a period of four months from today.

**Land Acquisition Act 18994 \- Section 23-** The computation of compensation for acquisition must be guided by the “market value of the land as on the date of publication of the Section 4 notification” \- ‘Market value’ to represent ‘the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in light of the land’s condition and potentiality'-Of course, in ordinary circumstances, the best way to identify this price is by considering instances of sale of similar or comparable lands. Such exemplars can serve as a foundation for determining compensation, so long as they fulfil the following requirements: i. The sale exemplar depicts a genuine, open-market transaction; ii. The land covered by the sale deed is in the vicinity of the acquired land; iii. The land covered by the sale deed is similar in nature to the acquired land; and iv. The sale was executed at a time proximate to the date of the notification issued under Section 4 of the 1894 Act. Any sale exemplar which is presented to the Court ought to be considered on the touchstone of these requirements, so that the most representative sale instance can be determined. 15\. Sale instances, however, cannot guide us to the market value of the land with exactitude. In some cases, direct examples of sale of comparable land may not be available, while in other cases, there may be relevant distinguishing features between the sale exemplar and the acquired land. In such cases, Courts adopt the process of guesstimation to apply the evidence and arrive at an equitable price for the acquired land. (Para 12-15) As a rule of thumb, sale instances which take place after the initiation of the acquisition are not reliable sources to compute land acquisition compensation. This position arises from the tendency of land value in the area to appreciate upon acquisition, expecting benefits from the public purpose of the acquisition. For example, the acquisition of land for development of commercial hubs, residential projects, and arterial roads would inevitably shoot up the price of the other nearby land. As such, post-Section 4 sale instances are bound to be skewed. (Para 25\)

### [**Angadi Chandranna vs Shankar 2025 INSC 532 \- Hindu Law \- Joint Family Property \- Doctrine Of Blending \- Partition \- Second Appeal**](https://www.caseciter.com/angadi-chandranna-vs-shankar-2025-iinsc-532-hindu-law-joint-family-property-doctrine-of-blending-partition-second-appeal/)

**Hindu Law \-Partition** \- After partition, each party gets a separate and distinct share and this share becomes their self-acquired property and they have absolute rights over it and they can sell, transfer, or bequeath it as they wish. Accordingly, the properties bequeathed through partition, become the self- acquired properties of the respective sharers. (Para 17\)  
**Hindu Law \- Doctrine of blending of self-acquired property with joint family \-**Property separate or self- acquired of a member of joint Hindu family may be impressed with the character of joint family property if it is voluntarily thrown by the owner into the common stock with the intention of abandoning his separate claim therein but to establish such abandonment a clear intention to waive separate rights must be established. From the mere fact that other members of the family were allowed to use the property jointly with himself, or that the income of the separate property was utilized out of generosity to support persons whom the holder was either bound or not bound to support, or from the failure to maintain separate accounts, abandonment cannot be inferred, for an act of generosity or kindness, will not ordinarily be regarded as an admission of a legal obligation. (Para 20\) There is no presumption of a property being joint family property only on account of existence of a joint Hindu family. The one who asserts has to prove that the property is a joint family property. If, however, the person so asserting proves that there was nucleus with which the joint family property could be acquired, then there would be presumption of the property being joint and the onus would shift on the person who claims it to be self-acquired property to prove that he purchased the property with his own funds and not out of joint family nucleus that was available. That apart, while considering the term ‘nucleus’ it should always be borne in mind that such nucleus has to be established as a matter of fact and the existence of such nucleus cannot normally be presumed or assumed on probabilities. (Para 13\)  
**Hindu Law- Karta \-** When the income derived from the joint family property or when a joint family property is sold and the sale consideration is utilised for maintenance and education within the joint family, the same are to be treated as out of necessity as it is the duty of every Kartha to do so. Hence, it is sufficient to satisfy the legal necessity if the Kartha had sold the property and used the funds for upbringing the children. That apart, under the customary practices and tradition in this country, it is the father who performs the marriage of his children and therefore, the expenses incurred for that purposes are also to be treated as expenses out of necessity. (Para 19.1)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 100-103** \- The authority to re-consider the evidence is available only to the First Appellate Court under Section 96 and not to the High Court in exercise of its authority under Section 100, unless the case falls under the exceptional circumstances provided under Section 103- High Court can go into the findings of facts only if the First Appellate Court has failed to look into the law or evidence or considered inadmissible evidence or without evidence. Section 103 permits the High Court to go into the facts only when the courts below have not determined or rendered any finding on a crucial fact, despite evidence already available on record or after deciding the substantial question of law, the facts of a particular case demand re-determination. For the second limb of Section 103 to apply, there must first be a decision on the substantial question of law, to which the facts must be applied, to determine the issue in dispute. When the First Appellate Court in exercise of its jurisdiction has considered the entire evidence and rendered a finding, the High Court cannot re-appreciate the evidence just because another view is possible, when the view taken by the First Appellate Court is plausible and does not suffer from vice in law. When the determination of the High Court is only by way of re-appreciation of the existing evidence, without there being any legal question to be answered, it would be axiomatic that not even a question of law is involved, much less a substantial one.

**Waqf Act 1995 \- Section 14 \-** Ex-Member of the Bar Council would constitute the electoral college only when there is no eligible Member as provided for in Section 14(1)(b)(iii) and the proviso contained therein. This means that if there is no serving Muslim Member in the Bar Council and also no Senior Muslim advocate who is available, only then would an ex-Member of the Bar Council be eligible to be a Member of the Board- An existing Muslim Member of the Board from the Bar Council, would cease to be a Member of the Board, upon the completion of their tenure as a Member of the Bar Council, when there is another Muslim Member available to replace them from within the Bar Council- There is no conscious intention on the part of the Legislature to omit the applicability of Explanation II to Section 14(1)(b) of the 1995 Act, to Muslim Members of the Board elected from the Bar Council. (Para 13\) \- the term of a Member of the Bar Council serving on the Board, is co-terminus with their membership in the Bar Council itself (Para 15\)  
**Interpretation of Statutes \-** To interpret a legislative provision, what must be primarily considered is its substantive part. An explanation simply performs a clarifying function. In other words, the substantive part of a provision cannot be understood solely from the point of view of an explanation. \- An explanation, which is simply in the nature of a clarification as regards certain categories, cannot be read in a manner which is violative of the substantive part of the provision. Although normally, a proviso cannot be used to understand the substantive part of the provision, there is no absolute bar in doing so, particularly in cases where the statute is peculiar and the proviso does not create any exception. For the aforementioned purpose, an explanation can also be understood through the proviso. In other words, if a proviso or an explanation, as the case may be, is phrased in a manner which throws more light on the objective behind the substantive part of the provision, there would be no difficulty in appreciating the same. Ultimately, a proviso or an explanation may be used for several purposes. Therefore, what is required is that Courts appreciate the context of such usage before rendering an interpretation to a provision vis-a-vis the proviso or explanation contained therein. (Para 14\)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 14** \-A classification would be reasonable only when there is an intelligible differentia which has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved through the statute. (Para 15\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 498A : Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 \- Section 84 \-** Constitutional Validity upheld \-While it is acknowledged that certain individuals may face hardship due to the misuse of the provision, it is equally important to look beyond these instances and recognize that the provision serves a constitutionally sound objective. It is aimed at protecting a vulnerable section of society that often requires legal support and institutional safeguards to shield them from systemic abuse and exploitation. The provisions were enacted in furtherance of the principle of positive discrimination envisaged under Article 15 of the Constitution of India, which expressly empowers the State to make special laws for the protection and advancement of women, children and other disadvantaged groups- **Re: misuse** : For every such instance, there are likely hundreds of genuine cases where Section 498A has served as a crucial safeguard for victims of domestic cruelty. We are also aware that certain unconscionable individuals, emboldened by the rising fervor to dismantle such protective provisions, have gone so far as to publicly share videos depicting the exchange of dowry —an act not only unlawful but also indicative of the entrenched nature of the very evil this provision seeks to combat- The harsh truth is that dowry continues to persist as a deeply entrenched social evil, prevalent across vast sections of the country. A significant majority of such cases go unreported, with countless women compelled to endure injustice in silence. This underscores the continuing need for legal provisions such as Section 498A, which serve as vital instruments of protection and redressal for those most vulnerable.  
**Constitution of India \- Article 32.226-** Courts refrain from intervening in matters of legislative policy or mandate unless the provision in question is: (i) devoid of reasonable justification or basis; (ii) actuated by mala fides or an ulterior motive; (iii) lacking a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved; or (iv) in violation of Fundamental Rights or any other constitutional provision. (Para 4\) mere possibility or occasional misuse of a legal provision does not render it constitutionally infirm, either procedurally or substantively. (Para 6\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 197-** Protection of sub-section (1) of Section 197, Cr. PC is available only to such public servants whose appointing authority is the Central Government or the State Government and not to every public servant. (Para 26\)  
**Service Law \- Deputation \-** Where exigency of public service requires the parent department (lending authority) to send its employee on deputation to the receiving department (borrowing authority) and such an arrangement is preceded by a consensus among the three, i.e., the lending authority, the borrowing authority and the officer/employee, the statutory rules do normally provide for his repatriation. In such a case, there can be no severance of relationship with the parent department. However, during the period the officer/employee is sent on deputation to the receiving department, the parent department may fill up the post vacated by the deputationist in accordance with law under the category of ‘deputation vacancy’, which also is not unknown in public service law, but it is only for a limited period till the officer/employee is repatriated- Insofar as disciplinary control over a deputationist is concerned, such control generally vests with the appropriate authority in the parent department in which the substantive appointment is held. However, it cannot be gainsaid that by statutory rules or by conditions contained in the order of deputation, it can be provided that the deputationist, for the period he is serving on deputation, will be subject to the disciplinary control of the department to which he is deputed. Should there be a provision in this behalf, the deputationist may be proceeded against, if the occasion therefore arises, by the appropriate authority in the receiving department. Although generally an employee is supposed to have one master, in the context of deputation there could be a plurality of masters. Nonetheless, it is the statutory rules which would be the deciding factor. If the rules indicate that disciplinary control is retained by the parent department, the receiving department would have no jurisdiction to exercise such control. (Para 20-21)

**Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 \- Section 4 \-** Unless applicability is excluded, in a case where the circumstances stated in sub- section (1) of Section 4 of the Probation Act are attracted, the court has no discretion to omit from its consideration release of the offender on probation; on the contrary, a mandatory duty is cast upon the court to consider whether the case before it warrants releasing the offender upon fulfilment of the stated circumstances. The question of grant of probation could be decided either way. In the event, the court in its discretion decides to extend the benefit of probation, it may upon considering the report of the probation officer impose such conditions as deemed just and proper. However, if the answer be in the negative, it would only be just and proper for the court to record the reasons therefor. (para 28\) The report of the probation officer referred to in sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the Probation Act is a condition precedent and, therefore, must be complied with by the trial courts and the high courts. Importantly, it has also been held that the courts may not be bound by such report.(Para 30\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 360,361 ; Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 \- Section 4** \- While Section 360 permits release of an offender, more twenty-one years old, on probation when he is sentenced to imprisonment for less than seven years or fine, Section 4 of the Probation Act enables a court to exercise its discretion in any case where the offender is found to have committed an offence such that he is punishable with any sentence other than death or life imprisonment. Additionally, the non-obstante clause in sub-section gives overriding effect to sub-section (1) of Section 4 over any other law for the time being in force. Also, it is noteworthy that Section 361, Cr. PC itself, being a subsequent legislation, engrafts a provision that in any case where the court could have dealt with an accused under the provisions of the Probation Act but has not done so, it shall record in its judgment the special reasons therefor.

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \-Order VI Rule 2-** Pleadings, either in a plaint or a written statement, constitute the plinth on which the respective claims and defence of the parties to a civil suit rest. What a pleading ought to contain is provided in Order VI Rule 2, CPC. Only material facts, on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence to succeed, have to be stated without the evidence by which the pleading is to be proved. (Para 19\)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \-The rights of a defendant in a civil suit where such defendant has been set ex parte. \-** Once the pleadings are complete but the defendant is set ex parte, and such order has attained finality, the defendant’s rights suffer a curtailment. He cannot produce evidence in defence and hence statements, which are in the nature of factual assertions, cannot be proved by leading evidence. Generally speaking, the limited right that the defendant, set ex parte, would have is confined to cross-examining the plaintiff’s witnesses. The effort has to be directed towards demonstrating that they are not speaking the truth and, thereby, demolish the case of the plaintiff. Essentially, therefore, in such a case the defendant has to convince the court that the case put up by the plaintiff is so false that the court ought not to accept it. However, if the defendant raises an issue on law which is traceable in the written statement, for instance, the suit is barred by limitation or Section 9, CPC is attracted, or if the relief claimed in the suit cannot be granted for reasons disclosed, the requirement of the defendant proving such defence as raised in the written statement by leading evidence may not arise and the court may frame an issue of law and decide the same.

It is an error apparent on the face of the record and does not depend for its discovery on argument or disputation.

**Limitation Act 1961 \- Article 58-** If cause of action to sue means accrual of the right for an actionable claim, it is the moment from which such right first accrues that the clock of limitation would start ticking \-Even though cause of action for instituting a suit might arise on varied occasions and/or at different times, what is material and assumes relevance for computing the period of limitation under Article 58 is the date when the right to sue first accrues to the aggrieved suitor. Though dominus litus, a suitor cannot pick and choose a time for approaching court. The period of limitation in terms of Article 58 being 3 (three) years, the prescribed period has to be counted from that date of the right to sue first accruing and the suit, if not instituted within 3 (three) years therefrom, would become barred by time. (Para 30\)  
**Limitation Act 1961 \- Article 59**\- Any suit seeking cancellation of a particular instrument as void or voidable would be governed by Article 59 and, therefore, has to be instituted within 3 (three) years from date the suitor could be said to have first derived knowledge of the fact of such an instrument (which, according to him, is void or voidable) coming into existence. The word “first” in Article 59 would ordinarily have the same connotation as in Article 58\. (Para 31\)

**Suit for declaration of title \-**The declaration of title is as good as a relief of cancellation of the sale deed or at least, a declaration that the sale deed is not binding on the plaintiff being void and thus non est. (Para 36\)  
**Specific Relief Act 1963 \- Section 31 and 34** \-Where the executant of a deed wants it to be annulled, he has to seek cancellation of the deed under Section 31 of the Act, 1963\. But if a non-executant seeks annulment of a deed, he has to only seek a declaration that the deed is invalid, or non est, or illegal or that it is not binding on him. The difference between a prayer for cancellation and declaration in regard to a deed of transfer/conveyance, can be brought out by the following illustration relating to ‘A’ and ‘B’ ─ two brothers. ‘A’ executes a sale deed in favour of ‘C’. Subsequently ‘A’ wants to avoid the sale. ‘A’ has to sue for cancellation of the deed. On the other hand, if ‘B’, who is not the executant of the deed, wants to avoid it, he has to sue for a declaration that the deed executed by ‘A’ is invalid/void and non est/ illegal and he is not bound by it. In essence, both may be suing to have the deed set aside or declared as non-binding. (Para 29\)  
**Reliefs** \- Plaint must be read as a whole and the actual relief sought can also be culled out from the averments of the plaint. Those reliefs can be granted, if there is evidence and circumstances justifying the grant of such relief, though not directly or specifically claimed, or asked as a relief. (Para 37\)  
**Specific Relief Act 1963 \- Section 34** \- Section 34 entitles a person to approach the appropriate court for a declaration, if that person is entitled to (i) any legal character or (ii) any right as to any property. “Legal character” and “right to property” are used disjunctively so that either of them, exclusively, may be the basis of a suit. The disjunctive ‘or’ cannot be read as a conjunctive ‘and’ (Para 26)- Courts have ample inherent powers and indeed it is their duty to shape their declaration in such a way that they may operate to afford the relief which the justice of the case requires. Section 34 of the Act, 1963 is not exhaustive of the cases in which a declaratory decree may be made and the courts have power to grant such a decree independently of the requirements of the Section. Section 34 merely gives statutory recognition to a well-recognised type of declaratory relief and subjects it to a limitation, but it cannot be deemed to exhaust every kind of declaratory relief or to circumscribe the jurisdiction of courts to give declarations of right in appropriate cases falling outside Section 34\. The circumstances in which a declaratory decree under Section 34 should be awarded is a matter of discretion depending upon the facts of each case. (para 38\) **Section 34 proviso** \- All that the proviso forbids is a suit for pure declaration without necessary relief where the plaintiff being able to seek such a relief, has omitted to do so. The proviso must not be construed in a manner which compels the plaintiff to sue for any and all the reliefs which could possibly be granted to him. The plaintiff must not be debarred from obtaining a relief that he wants for the reason that he has failed to seek a relief which is not directly flowing from the relief of declaration already sought for.(Para 28\)  
**Specific Relief Act 1963 \- Section 31 \-**As Section 31 of the Act, 1963 uses the word “may”, it is not a mandate, even as regards the parties to the instrument or the persons claiming through or under them, to seek for the cancellation of an instrument which is otherwise void and therefore, it cannot be contended that a stranger to that instrument must necessarily seek for its cancellation. By no stretch of imagination can this be construed to mean that when there exists an instrument with respect to the same property but executed by some other person, the plaintiff despite being a stranger to that instrument would fall under the scope of “any person” in Section 31 of the Act, 1963\.

**Disciplinary Proceedings** \- If there is a flaw from the inception of the disciplinary proceedings, i.e., the charge-sheet is not issued conforming to the relevant rules and the charged officer finds it difficult to meet the charges because it is vague, indefinite, not specific and lacking in material particulars, the charge- sheet itself becomes susceptible to vulnerability. (Para 35\) \- In carrying out the purpose of rooting out corruption, mere suspicion should not be allowed to take the place of proof even in domestic enquiries. Although technical rules which govern criminal trials in courts may not necessarily apply to disciplinary proceedings, nevertheless, the principle that in punishing the guilty scrupulous care should be taken to see that the innocent is not punished, applies as much to regular criminal trials as to disciplinary enquiries held under statutory rules. (Para 42\) While an acquittal in a criminal case does not automatically entitle the accused to have an order of setting aside of his dismissal from public service following disciplinary proceedings, it is well-established that when the charges, evidence, witnesses, and circumstances in both the departmental inquiry and the criminal proceedings are identical or substantially similar, the situation assumes a different context. In such cases, upholding the findings in the disciplinary proceedings would be unjust, unfair, and oppressive. (Para 47\) To assess the degree of similarity between the charges, evidence, witnesses, and circumstances in the disciplinary and criminal proceedings, it is indeed crucial to review the materials placed before the Court where such an issue arises. (Para 48\)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \- Disciplinary Proceedings** \- While exercising its powers under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, the High Court does not exercise powers that are available to an appellate court. It is the decision-making process that falls for scrutiny. Be that as it may, the High Courts can rectify errors of law or procedural irregularities, if any, that lead to a manifest miscarriage of justice or breach of the principles of natural justice. (Para 55\)  
**Natural Justice** \- Any action resulting in penal or adverse consequences must be consistent with the principles of natural justice. To sustain a complaint of natural justice violation, based on lack of opportunity for cross-examination, the party alleging the violation must show that prejudice was caused. (Para 56\)

**Disciplinary Proceedings** \- Whenever a challenge is mounted to an order of punishment on, inter alia, the ground that the report of enquiry has not been furnished, the tribunal/court should require the employer (Government, public or private) to justify non- furnishing of such report. If no valid explanation is proffered and the tribunal/court suspects unfair motives (report has not been furnished as part of a strategic ploy or to advance an unholy cause or prompted by extraneous reasons) or carelessness, without much ado and without insisting for ‘prejudice’ to be demonstrated, the order of punishment should be set aside and the proceedings directed to resume from the stage of offering opportunity to the delinquent employee to respond to the enquiry report. Irrespective of ‘prejudice’ being demonstrated, no employer or for that matter anyone should be permitted to steal a march and gain any benefit by violating the law. In case the tribunal/court is satisfied that real effort was made by the employer but such effort remained abortive because the report could not be furnished to the employee for reason(s) beyond its control, or some other justification is placed on record, which is acceptable to the tribunal/court, the test of ‘prejudice’ is open to be applied but only after ensuring service of a copy of the enquiry report on the employee. In a case where the employee either expressly or by his conduct appears to have waived the requirement of having access to the report, it would be open to the tribunal/court to deal with the situation as per its discretion. (Para 51\)  
**Disciplinary Proceedings** \- continuation of disciplinary proceedings beyond the time stipulated by a tribunal/court could invite interdiction if no bona fide attempt is shown to have been made to seek an extension of time. However, much would depend on the facts of each case and it may not be possible to lay down a common formula applicable to each case. In an exceptional case, the tribunal/court would have the discretion to overlook the laxity and make such direction as it deems fit in the circumstances. (Para 63\)  
**Disciplinary Proceedings** \- Non-furnishing of the enquiry report would deprive the employee of the opportunity and disable him to demonstrate before the disciplinary authority the perversity in such report by filing a representation. The object that is sought to be achieved by furnishing of the enquiry report is this. If the report were furnished, the delinquent employee could persuade the disciplinary authority to hold that either he is innocent and/or that he does not deserve any punishment, or may be let off with a minor punishment. Providing a delinquent employee with an opportunity to respond to the enquiry report is, thus, a crucial procedural step that must precede disciplinary action. Failure to do so, such as imposing punishment without furnishing the report, could severely handicap the employee’s ability to effectively question or challenge the decision in an appeal/appropriate proceedings, as he would be unaware of the materials against him. In such a case, at best, nothing more than a plain and simple plea can be urged that non-furnishing of the enquiry report has deprived him of reasonable opportunity to counter the findings of guilt without, however, he being able to demonstrate prejudice. It is axiomatic that without reading the enquiry report, there cannot be an effective and meaningful challenge to the findings contained therein. 45\. That apart, the right to receive the report of enquiry being available prior to a final decision being taken in the disciplinary proceedings cannot be postponed by any arbitrary act of the employer in not following the law, which can be or should be validated by the court, and what was intended to be a pre-decisional opportunity cannot be made to partake the character of a post-decisional opportunity. (Para 44-45)  
**Disciplinary Proceedings** \- ‘Materials brought on record by the parties’ (to which consideration in the enquiry ought to be confined) mean only such materials can be considered which are brought on record in a manner known to law. Such materials can then be considered legal evidence, which can be acted upon. Though the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is not strictly applicable to departmental enquiries, which are not judicial proceedings, nevertheless, the principles flowing therefrom can be applied in specific cases. Evidence tendered by witnesses must be recorded in the presence of the delinquent employee, he should be given opportunity to cross- examine the witnesses and no document should be relied on by the prosecution without giving copy thereof to the delinquent \- all these basic principles of fair play have their root in such Act.

**Leave encashment**\- Leave encashment is a legal entitlement that exists within the framework of service law and in the welfare of the employee. It allows employees to receive a monetary benefit in exchange for leave they have earned but not taken during regular employment. This right is based on the principle of deferred compensation to an employee who has not taken leaves and served, for which the employer must compensate not only for his/her work, but also for benefits of leave accumulated over time limited to 300 days maximum. This entitlement is often established in statutory provisions, service rules (such as Rule 36 of the Leave Rules) or employment contracts, ensuring that employees are fairly compensated for their unutilized leave- while leave encashment ensures that extra- ordinary work ethic of an employee is rewarded, it must be applied in a way that upholds both employee rights and institutional sustainability. Naturally, courts must interpret leave encashment rules and statutes in a manner that prevents undue financial burden on employers while ensuring that employees receive what they are lawfully entitled to. (Para 25-27)

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Order IX Rule 4 \-**Whether after the dismissal of the petition for restoration of suit under Order IX Rule 4 of the C.P.C. a fresh suit is maintainable? A fresh suit is maintainable even after the rejection of the application filed under Order IX Rule 4 of the C.P.C- In case of dismissal of suit under Order IX Rule 4 of the C.P.C. the plaintiff has both the remedies of filing of fresh suit or application for restoration of the suit. If he chooses one remedy, he is not debarred from availing himself of the other remedy. Both these remedies are simultaneous and would not exclude either of them. (Para 21\)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Order IX Rule 2,3**\-Whether after dismissal of the suit for default, a fresh suit is barred by res judicata? If a fresh suit is filed, then such an order of dismissal cannot and shall not operate a res judicata. (Para 26\)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Order IX Rule 2,3,4,8-** where the suit is dismissed under Rule 2 or Rule 3 of Order IX, the remedy provided is under Rule 4 of Order IX of the C.P.C. In case of such dismissal, the plaintiff either brings a fresh suit on the same cause of action or he may apply for setting aside the order of dismissal and for restoration of suit. Whereas if the suit is dismissed under Rule 8 of Order IX of the C.P.C., the plaintiff cannot bring a fresh suit on the same cause of action. The only remedy available to the plaintiff is to move an application for setting aside the order of dismissal and for restoration of suit. (Para 16\)  
**Code of Civil Procedure 1908- Order IX Rule 2,3**\- An order of dismissal of a suit or application in default under Rule 2 or Rule 3 of Order IX of the C.P.C. is neither an adjudication or a decree nor it is an appealable order. If that is so, such order of dismissal of a suit under Rule 2 or Rule 3 of Order IX of the C.P.C. does not fulfill the requirement of the term “judgment” or “decree”, inasmuch as there is no adjudication. (Para 26\)

**Res Judicata \-** The principle of res judicata is based on the common law maxim “nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa”, which means that no man shall be vexed twice over the same cause of action. It is a doctrine applied to give finality to a lis. According to this doctrine, an issue or a point once decided and attends finality, should not be allowed to be reopened and re-agitated in a subsequent suit. In other words, if an issue involved in a suit is finally adjudicated by a Court of competent jurisdiction, the same issue in a subsequent suit cannot be allowed to be re-agitated. It is, therefore, clear that for the application of principle of res judicata, there must be an adjudication of an issue in a suit by a court of competent jurisdiction. (Para 23\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \-Section 482-** Though the High Court has unfettered powers conferred by the CrPC for exercising its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482., the same is expected to be used very sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances. There cannot be any straight jacket formula as to when the High Court would be justified to exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrPC and each case is required to be dealt with on its own merits. (Para 18\) There is a growing tendency of parties to rope in their counterparts to harass and extract monetary transaction, it is the duty of the Court to consider the facts of each case, in its proper perspective and then to arrive at the conclusion as to whether the case warrants investigation or the proceedings are required to be quashed. (Para 24\) economic offences by their very nature lie beyond the domain of mere dispute between private parties and the High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or misdemeanour. (Para 23\)  
**Economic offences \-**economic offences by their very nature stand on a different footing than other offences and have wider ramifications. They constitute a class apart.

**Criminal Investigation \-** The principles of natural justice are not applicable at the stage of reporting a criminal offence. It has further been clarified that providing an opportunity of being heard prior to the commencement of a criminal action (i.e. registration of an FIR), would frustrate the very purpose of initiating a criminal proceeding, which is to meet the ends of justice. (Para 10\) An FIR, by taking cognizance of an offence, merely sets the law into motion. This has nothing to do with a decision on the administrative side, made by a different authority. Merely because the facts are same or similar, one cannot say that in the absence of a valid administrative action, no offence which is otherwise cognizable, can be registered. At that stage, one only has to see the existence of a cognizable offence, based on the FIR registered. Therefore, even assuming that there is no action forthcoming on the administrative side, an FIR can be held to be maintainable. The scope and role of both the actions are totally different and distinct, more so when undertaken by different statutory/public authorities- Even in a case where an FIR is registered based on an administrative action, setting aside the latter on a technical or a legal premise would not ipso facto nullify the former. It is ultimately a matter for investigation by the appropriate authority. When an administrative order is set aside on the ground of non-compliance of a legal necessity or mandate, the facts mentioned thereunder could still be the basis for the registration of an FIR. (Para 7-8)  
**Disciplinary Proceedings \-** Setting aside of an administrative action on the grounds of violation of the principles of natural justice does not bar the administrative authorities from proceeding afresh. (Para 12\)

**Indian Contract Act 1872 \- Section 55,73,74 \-** In a contract whether time is of the essence or not, if the contractor fails to execute the contract within the specified time, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the promisee and the promisee would be entitled to compensation from the promisor for any loss occasioned to him by such failure. However, in case of a contract where time is of the essence, the contract becomes voidable on account of the contractor’s failure to execute the contract within the agreed time. The promisee cannot claim compensation for any loss occasioned by such breach of the contract unless he gives notice to the promisor of his intention to claim compensation. This is made more specific in Section 73\. Section 74 contemplates a situation where penalty is provided for and quantified as compensation for breach of contract. In such a case, the party complaining of the breach is entitled to compensation whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby but such compensation shall not exceed the quantum of penalty stipulated. (Para 20\)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 34 \-** An arbitral award cannot be set aside on a ground which is beyond the grounds mentioned in sub-sections (2) and (2A) of Section 34\. (Para 22\) Court. Section 34 is not in the nature of an appellate provision. It provides for setting aside an arbitral award that too only on very limited grounds i.e. as those contained in sub-sections (2) and (2A) of Section 34\. It is the only remedy for setting aside an arbitral award. An arbitral award is not liable to be interfered with only on the ground that the award is illegal or is erroneous in law which would require re-appraisal of the evidence adduced before the arbitral tribunal. If two views are possible, there is no scope for the court to re-appraise the evidence and to take the view other than the one taken by the arbitrator. The view taken by the arbitral tribunal is ordinarily to be accepted and allowed to prevail. Thus, the scope of interference in arbitral matters is only confined to the extent envisaged under Section 34 of the Act. The court exercising powers under Section 34 has perforce to limit its jurisdiction within the four corners of Section 34\. It cannot travel beyond Section 34\. Thus, proceedings under Section 34 are summary in nature and not like a full-fledged civil suit or a civil appeal. The award as such cannot be touched unless it is contrary to the substantive provisions of law or Section 34 of the 1996 Act or the terms of the agreement. (Para 23\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 154** \- Even in the absence of a formal informant, the police is duty-bound to register the case whenever they receive any information regarding the commission of a cognizable offence. (Para 69\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 162,165 \-** The Courts are not barred from putting questions which may contradict the witness with the previous statements made before the police. The special powers of the Court under Section 165 of the Evidence Act are not impaired or controlled by the provisions of Section 162 of the CrPC (Para 51)- The importance of Section 165 in the meaningful conduct of a trial discussed \- Referred to Ram Chander v. State of Haryana (1981) 3 SCC 191\. (Para 52\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Sections 311, 162,165 \-** Powers under Section 311 CrPC can either be exercised on an application moved by either side to the case or suo moto by the Court. In case a person is not listed as a witness in the charge-sheet but later, the prosecution desires to bring that person as an additional prosecution witness, then the prosecution can move an application to bring this person as a prosecution witness. It is then for the Court to decide whether such a person is required as a witness or not. If the Court finds that such a person should have been examined as a prosecution witness and he/she was omitted from the list of witnesses due to some oversight, mistake or for any other reason, the Court may allow the application and such a person can be examined as a prosecution witness. Thereafter, the normal course of examination-in-chief, cross- examination, etc. would follow as per the procedure. On the other hand, when the Court calls a person as a Court witness, there are some restrictions regarding the cross-examination of such witness- In a case where neither party is interested in examining a person as a witness yet the Court feels that the evidence of such a person is necessary for a just decision, the Court though cannot compel either the prosecution or the defence to call a witness, but it can invoke its power under Section 311 CrPC, read with Section 165 of the Evidence Act and call such a person as a Court witness. Whether a person is required to be examined as a witness for a just decision is again a question which has to be decided by the Court on the basis of the facts of that particular case. (Para 49\) As far as cross-examination of a Court witness is concerned, no party can claim cross-examination of a Court witness as a matter of right. A Court witness can only be examined with the leave of the Court \-Where a Court witness says something prejudicial to any party, then such a party must be allowed to cross-examine that witness- Court witnesses can be cross- examined by either side but only with the leave of the Court. Further, the cross-examination is to be restricted only to what was stated by this witness in his/her reply to the questions of the Court, and a Court witness cannot be contradicted to his/her previous statements made before the police i.e. statements under section 161 of CrPC. (Para 48-51)  
**Criminal Trial \-** Court cannot ignore the testimonies of witnesses only because they are close relatives of the victim- In cases where the crime is committed at the residence or a place near the residence of the deceased, it is the close relatives who are likely to be a witness to the crime. They are natural witnesses. (Para 39\)  
**Criminal Trial \-** **Hostile Witness \-** The phrase ‘hostile witness’ has come to be used for a witness who gives a statement contrary to the story of the side for which he/she is a witness. All the same, because a witness has supported some, though not all, aspects of a case, it would not automatically mean that this witness has to be declared ‘hostile’. the maxim “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus”, is not applicable to our criminal justice system. It is for the Court to distinguish the wheat from the chaff while dealing with the depositions of a hostile witness. Courts can rely upon that part of the deposition of a hostile witness which is corroborated by other evidence on record. If part of the evidence of a hostile witness corroborates with other reliable evidence, then that part of the evidence is admissible. Once a prosecution witness has been declared hostile and then cross-examined by the prosecution, then it is for the Court to evaluate the veracity of the testimony. There can be several reasons for a witness to turn hostile and the court must also look into these factors while evaluating the evidence given by a hostile witness. (Para 36\)  
**Indian Evidence Act \- Section 154** \- A party can cross-examine its own witness under Section 154 Evidence Act, even without getting a declaration of ‘hostility’. The only restriction to cross- examination under Section 154 Evidence Act is that the party, who seeks to cross-examine its own witness, must obtain the leave of the Court. Whether there is a declaration of ‘hostility’ or not, one thing is clear that evidence of witness, who has been cross-examined under Section 154 Evidence Act by the party who called such witness, cannot be washed off entirely and it is for the Court to see what can be retrieved from such evidence. (Para 31\)  
**Honor Killing** \- A wicked and odious crime is the ugly reality of our deeply entrenched caste structure. Honour-killing, as these are called, must get a strong measure of punishment. (Para 75\)  
**Criminal Investigation \-** The purpose of an investigation, like the purpose of a trial, is to reach to the truth. The duty of an Investigating Officer is to lawfully collect evidence. (Para 67\)

[**Chunni Bai vs State Of Chhattisgarh 2025 INSC 577 \- S.84 IPC \- Insanity \- Murder \- S. 165 Evidence Act**](https://www.caseciter.com/2025-insc-577-chunni-bai-vs-state-of-chhattisgarh-s-84-ipc-insanity-murder-s-165-evidence-act/)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 84 \-**What Section 84 IPC provides is legal insanity as distinguished from medical insanity. A person is said to be of unsound mind on whom criminal liability cannot be fastened if at the time of commission of the act, he is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that what he was doing was either wrong or contrary to law. It may also be noted that the expression “unsoundness of mind” or the word “insanity” has not been defined in the Indian Penal Code, though these have been used interchangeably. In the absence of a precise definition of these terms, insanity or unsoundness of mind has been variously understood by courts in varying degrees of mental disorder and the courts have applied this attribute to give the benefit of doubt or otherwise, depending on the facts and circumstances of the cases. However, mere odd behaviour or certain physical or mental ailments affecting the emotions or capacity to think and act properly have not been construed to be “unsound mind” within the scope of Section 84 of the IPC. All kinds of insanity as are understood are not covered under Section 84 of IPC but only such acts, when committed by a person who was incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he was doing which is either wrong or contrary to law are concerned. As a consequence, only such mental or medical condition which affects or disturbs the faculty of the person which renders him unable to know the nature of act committed or that he was doing which he did not know that it was wrong or contrary to law can be given the benefit of insanity under Section 84 IPC, and thus escape criminal liability. (Para 33\)  
**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 165** ; **Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 84**\- Re: Plea that the accused was under the influence of certain invisible force or where the prosecution is also totally unable to explain circumstances which motivated him or her to commit the act of homicide or where the evidence on record unambiguously show totally inexplicable but highly intriguing, strange and unusual circumstances under which the crime was committed \- If such circumstances emerge in course of the trial which remain inexplicable and bizarre as in the present case, the court, in our opinion, even if the accused opts to remain silent, should ask such questions to the witnesses, as may be necessary to elicit the truth by invoking Section 165 of the Evidence Act, since the court has to be satisfied that the offence alleged has been proved beyond reasonable doubt not only in respect of actusreas but also mens rea. This assumes great importance when the accused pleads existence of certain circumstances which are beyond his/her control and which may indicate unsoundness of mind even temporarily, incapacitating the accused to take a conscious and informed decision. It is for the salutary reason that if the accused at the time of commission of crime was incapable of making conscious and informed decision or was suffering from certain mental incapacity or unsoundness of mind even if temporarily, it may put a question mark on the “intention” of the accused in committing such a crime, in which event, the benefit of doubt may be extended to the accused as regards proof of intention and mens rea, as it would determine the nature of conviction and sentence which may be imposed. (Para 63-64)  
**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 299-304 \-** One of the criteria to determine, in any given case, as to whether the act amounts to “murder” or “culpable homicide not amounting to murder” is the presence or absence of intention of the offender. If the “intention” to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or the knowledge, which obviously has to be a conscious one, that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death and commits such act “without any excuse” for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury, comes out aloud and clear in the case, it would be most appropriate to categorise it as a case of “murder” under Section 300 IPC in which event, penal provision of Section 302 IPC would be attracted. On the other hand, if the “intention” in causing the death or to causing such bodily injury is not so clear, the case will fall under the less stringent category of “culpable homicide not amounting to murder” as punishable under Section 304 IPC.

[**Oswal Petrochemicals Ltd. vs Commissioner Of Central Excise, Mumbai 2025 INSC 578 \-Central Excise Rules**](https://www.caseciter.com/oswal-petrochemicals-ltd-vs-commissioner-of-central-excise-mumbai-2025-insc-578-central-excise-rules/)

**Central Excise Rules 1944-Rule 56-** The use of the word shall in sub-rule (2) is indicative of the mandatory nature of the provision. The officer who has taken the samples for testing has to communicate the result of such test to the manufacturer. Therefore, the officer is under a positive mandate to communicate to the manufacturer the result of such test. On the other hand, what sub-rule (4) contemplates is that upon receipt of the test result if a manufacturer is aggrieved by the same, he may within 90 days of the date on which the result of the test is received by him, request the Assistant Commissioner that the samples be re- tested. Unless a copy of the test report is furnished to the manufacturer, he would not be in a position to seek re-test within the specified period, if he is aggrieved by the result of the test. Therefore, a copy of the test report has to be furnished to the manufacturer. In such circumstances, extracting the gist of the test reports, that too in the show-cause notices, would clearly be in breach of Rule 56 (2) and Rule 56 (4) of the Central Excise Rules. Such a procedure is not contemplated under Rule 56\. That apart, it will defeat the right of a manufacturer to seek re-test if he is aggrieved by the result of the test. CESTAT has missed the point when it says that appellant was aware of the test report as gist of the same was communicated to it through the medium of the show-cause notices but it never sought for any re-test- The manufacturer can seek re-test within the stipulated period only if he is furnished with a copy of the test report. (Para 39\)  
**Central Excise Rules 1944-Rule** **9B-** The first and foremost requirement of Rule 9B is that it is the assessee who has to request in writing the proper officer for provisional assessment in the event the assessee is unable to determine the value of excisable goods or the correct classification of goods. This is the first requirement. The second requirement is that the proper officer competent to make provisional assessment may direct after making necessary inquiry that duty leviable on such goods shall be assessed provisionally. Such directions the proper officer can issue only by passing a written order and not otherwise. Thirdly, the assessee must execute a bond in the proper form binding the assessee to pay the differential amount of duty as provisionally assessed and as may be finally assessed. However, Rule 9B also provides for an exception. If the proper officer is satisfied that the self-assessment made by the assessee is not in order, he may direct the assessee to resort to provisional assessment. In any event, for an assessment to be provisional in terms of Rule 9B, an order is required to be passed- in order to establish that the clearances were of provisional basis, an order under Rule 9B and payment of duty on provisional basis are essential.

**Indian Penal Code, 1860 \- Section 306 \-** the offence requires an active act or omission which led the deceased to commit suicide, and this act or omission must have been intended to push the deceased into committing suicide. \[**Context**:While upholding the conviction of the accused-mother in law, SC observed: the deceased was repeatedly tortured and abused by the accused on account of dowry demand to the extent that the deceased had to return to her parental home seeking refuge. It was only on the assurance of her parents that the deceased went back to her matrimonial home hoping that the events would take an upturn once her parents have returned from the wedding and settle the matter of dowry with the appellant- accused. However, the abuses hurled at the deceased by the appellant on the day of the incident, i.e. 04.05.1998, unfortunately acted as a straw that broke the camel’s back and led her to committing suicide.\] (Para 11\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482**\- Mere institution of civil proceedings is not a ground for quashing the FIR or to hold that the dispute is merely a civil dispute \- Simply because there is a remedy provided for breach of contract, that does not by itself clothe the Court to conclude that civil remedy is the only remedy, and the initiation of criminal proceedings, in any manner, will be an abuse of the process of the court- Merely because the offence was committed during a commercial transaction, it would not be sufficient to hold that the complaint did not warrant a further investigation and if necessary, a trial (Para 28)- Power of quashing of a complaint/FIR should be exercised sparingly with circumspection and while exercising this power, the Court must believe the averments and allegations in the complaint to be true and correct- Save in exceptional cases where non-interference would result in miscarriage of justice, the Court and the judicial process should not interfere at the stage of investigation of offences. Extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court should not be used in a routine manner according to its whims or caprice. (Para 29\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 468, 482**\- Delay in registration of the FIR for offences punishable with imprisonment of more than three years cannot be the basis of interdicting a criminal investigation. The delay will assume importance only when the complainant fails to give a plausible explanation and whether the explanation is plausible or not, has to be decided by the Trial Court only after recording the evidence. (Para 37)- There is no period of limitation for offences which are punishable with imprisonment of more than three years. (Para 40\)

**Consumer Protection Act 2019 \- Sections 3, 5, 10, 18 to 22 \-** Central Consumer Protection Council and the Central Consumer Protection Authority shall in exercise of their statutory duties under sections 3, 5, 10, 18 to 22 take such measures as may be necessary for survey, review and advise the government about such measures as may be necessary for effective and efficient redressal and working of the statute.  
**Constitution of India \- Article 246 \-**Parliament has the legislative competence to enact the Consumer Protection Act- Entry 95 of List I read with Entries 11-A and 46 of List II- The legislative competence to prescribe jurisdiction and powers of a court, coupled with the power to constitute and organize courts for administration of justice, takes within its sweep the power to prescribe pecuniary limits of jurisdiction of the courts or tribunals. Parliament has the legislative competence to prescribe jurisdiction and powers of courts. This power extends to prescribing different monetary values as the basis for exercising jurisdiction. (Para 9\)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 32-** **Performance Audit of the Statute \-** A peculiar feature of how our legislative system works is that an overwhelming majority of legislations are introduced and carried through by the Government, with very few private member bills being introduced and debated. In such circumstances, the judicial role does encompass, in this Court’s understanding, the power, nay the duty to direct the executive branch to review the working of statutes and audit the statutory impact. It is not possible to exhaustively enlist the circumstances and standards that will trigger such a judicial direction. One can only state that this direction must be predicated on a finding that the statute has, through demonstrable judicial data or other cogent material, failed to ameliorate the conditions of the beneficiaries. The courts will also do well, to at the very least, arrive at a prima facie finding that much statutory schemes and procedures are gridlocked in bureaucratic or judicial quagmires that impede or delay statutory objectives. This facilitative role of the judiciary compels audit of the legislation, promotes debate and discussion but does not and cannot compel legislative reforms. (Para 12.5)

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 \- Section 8,9-** Whether the notice served by the Operational Creditor upon the Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) of the Corporate Debtor at their registered office constitutes valid service of the statutory demand notice under Section 8 of the IBC, so as to maintain a section 9 petition for initiation of CIRP against the Corporate Debtor? SC held: It can be construed as a deemed service of demand notice as required under section 8 of the IBC. In such view of the matter, the approach of the NCLT and the NCLAT rejecting the section 9 petition on the technical ground that no notice was sent to the corporate debtor and the notice sent by the appellant to the KMP of the corporate debtor cannot be taken to be a notice issued under section 8 of the IBC, is incorrect and is unsustainable in law.(Para 14\)  
**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 \- Section 8,9-** An operational creditor must send a demand notice of unpaid operational debt to the corporate debtor as mandated under section 8 of the IBC, before initiating the proceedings under section 9 for CIRP and the failure to issue a proper demand notice can render the section 9 petition invalid- A section 9 petition can be filed only against the corporate debtor after giving prior notice under section 8 of the IBC to the corporate debtor; and the key requirements for filing the same are (i) demand notice under section 8 must be served on the corporate debtor; (ii) after 10 days, if the payment is not made or if there is no valid dispute, the application can be filed; (iii) application must be filed in Form 5 as prescribed by the Adjudicating Authority Rules, 2016; and (iv) supporting evidence such as invoices, bank statements, or written contracts must be attached. Further, a conjoint reading of section 8 of the IBC r/w Rule 5(2)(a) and (b) of the Adjudicating Authority Rules, 2016 would reveal that a demand notice under section 8 can be addressed and delivered to the corporate debtor through its KMP. (Para 8-8.1) \[**Context**: The issue raised in this case was \]  
**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 \- Section 8,9-** The trigger to initiate CIRP under section 9 of the IBC is occurrence of a “default” and not “mere existence of debt”. In other words, the operational creditor has to establish as to what is the actual date of default, failing which, the application filed under section 9 of the IBC is incomplete. (Para 15\)  
**Procedural Laws** \- ‘Laws of procedure are meant to regulate effectively, assist and aid the object of doing substantial and real justice and not to foreclose even an adjudication on merits of substantial rights of citizen under personal, property and other laws. Procedure has always been viewed as the handmaid of justice and not meant to hamper the cause of justice or sanctify miscarriage of justice’. It is also a trite law that ‘the procedural defect may fall within the purview of irregularity, but it should not be allowed to defeat the substantive right accrued to the litigant without affording reasonable opportunity’. In other words, a substantive right should not be allowed to be defeated merely on technicality. (Para 14.1)

The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case- while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation, a false allegation of rape also can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused as well.

❓  
*Whether the powers of the Court under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 will include the power to modify an arbitral award?*  
**Majority Judgment (4:1) \-** Court has a limited power under Sections 34 and 37 of the 1996 Act to modify the arbitral award.This limited power may be exercised under the following circumstances: I. when the award is severable, by severing the “invalid” portion from the “valid” portion of the award . II. by correcting any clerical, computational or typographical errors which appear erroneous on the face of the record, III. post award interest may be modified in some circumstances (Para 85\) The authority to set aside an arbitral award necessarily encompasses the power to set it aside in part, rather than in its entirety. The authority to sever the “invalid” portion of an arbitral award from the “valid” portion, while remaining within the narrow confines of Section 34, is inherent in the court’s jurisdiction when setting aside an award. (Para 33-34) Partial setting aside may not be feasible when the “valid” and “invalid” portions are legally and practically inseparable. In simpler words, the “valid” and “invalid” portions must not be inter-dependent or intrinsically intertwined. If they are, the award cannot be set aside in part \- the power of partial setting aside should be exercised only when the valid and invalid parts of the award can be clearly segregated—particularly in relation to liability and quantum and without any corelation between valid and invalid parts. (Para 35-36)  
**Dissenting opinion** by Viswanathan J: while exercising power under Section 34 of the A\&C Act and consequently the Courts in the appellate hierarchy do not have the power to modify the arbitral award. (Para 157\)  
❓  
If the power to modify the award is available, whether such power can be exercised only where the award is severable, and a part thereof can be modified?  
**Majority (4:1):** Section 34 court can apply the doctrine of severability and modify a portion of the award while retaining the rest. This is subject to parts of the award being separable, legally and practically.  
**Dissenting opinion**: Modification and severance are two different concepts while modification is not permitted under Section 34, severance of the award falling foul of Section 34 is permissible in exercise of powers under Section 34\. Such a power of severance is also available to the courts in the appellate hierarchy to the Section 34 Court. (Para 157\)  
❓  
*Whether the power to set aside an award under Section 34 of the Act, being a larger power, will include the power to modify an arbitral award and if so, to what extent? Whether the power to modify an award can be read into the power to set aside an award under Section 34 of the Act?*  
**Majority (4:1):** Power of judicial review under Section 34, and the setting aside of an award, should be read as inherently including a limited power to modify the award within the confines of Section 34 (Para 46\)  
**Dissenting opinion**: The power to set aside will not include the power to modify since the power to modify is not a lesser power subsumed in the power to set aside and the power to set aside and power to modify do not emanate from the same genus and are qualitatively different powers in the context of the A\&C Act.(Para 157\)  
❓  
Can Article 142 of the Constitution of India be invoked by Supreme Court to modify awards passed by arbitrators?  
**Majority (4:1):** The power should not be exercised where the effect of the order passed by the court would be to rewrite the award or modify the award on merits. However, the power can be exercised where it is required and necessary to bring the litigation or dispute to an end. Not only would this end protracted litigation, but it would also save parties’ money and time. (Para 84\)  
**Dissenting opinion**: Article 142 of the Constitution of India will not be exercised by this Court to modify awards passed by arbitrators as it is well settled that the Article 142 power cannot be used to give a go by to the substantive statutory provision. (Para 156\)  
❓  
Can Section 34 Court modify the post-award interest?  
**Majority Judgment:** It is appropriate for the Section 34 court to have the authority to intervene and modify the post-award interest if the facts and circumstances justify such a change \-court's power to both increase or decrease the post-award interest rate. It would be incorrect to state that the court's power to interfere with this interest rate is limited solely to decreasing the interest rate. Situations may arise where the rate should be increased due to delays or obstructions in the execution of the award. Interest rates may also fluctuate over time. However, the court, while exercising this power, must be cautious and mindful not to overstep its role by altering the interest rate unless there are compelling and well-founded reasons to do so. In exercising this power, the court is not acting in an appellate capacity, but rather under limited authority. For instance, the 1996 Act stipulates a standard post-award interest rate. When the statute itself benchmarks a standard, unless there are special and specific reasons, the rate of interest stipulated by the statute should be applied. 79\. Nevertheless, this limited power is significant, as it can help avoid further rounds of litigation. Without it, the court may be forced to set aside the entire award or order a fresh round of arbitration because of an erroneous interest rate rather than simply adjusting this rate. (Para 76-78)  
**Dissenting opinion:** Interest awarded also cannot be modified in exercise of powers of setting aside and the course of action under Section 34(4) will have to be adopted. (Para 156\)  
❓  
Should the request under Section 34(4) be in writing?  
**CJI Judgment:** The request may be oral. Nevertheless, there should be a request which is recorded by the court. (Para 62\)  
**Viswanathan J:** Even an oral request under Section 34(4) can be entertained by the Court. (Para 156\)  
❓  
Can the power under Section 34(4) can be exercised by the Court Suo Moto?  
**CJI Judgment**: No discussion on this aspect.  
**Viswanathan J:** The power under Section 34(4) can be exercised by the Court Suo Moto (Para 156\) If it arrives at an opinion that the award is vulnerable and the threat of setting aside is looming large and if within the parameters laid down in Section 34(4) the grounds for setting aside can be eliminated \- the case is appropriate and time is ripe for exercise of power under Section 34(4). The need for an application oral or in writing is really directory and does not militate against the exercise of Suo Moto powers in given cases by the Court. (Para 136\)

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34(4)** \- the power of remand permits the court only to send the award to the tribunal for reconsideration of specific aspects. It is not an open-ended process; rather, it is a limited power, confined to limited circumstances and issues identified by the court. Upon remand, the arbitral tribunal may proceed in a manner warranted by the situation – including recording additional evidence, affording a party an opportunity to present its case if previously denied, or taking any other corrective measures necessary to cure the defect.(Para 56\) An order of remand should not be passed when such order would place the arbitral tribunal in an invidious or embarrassing position. Additionally, remand may be inappropriate when it does not serve the interests of the parties, particularly in time-sensitive matters or where it would lead to undue costs and inefficiencies. Once an order of remand is granted, the arbitral tribunal has the authority to vary, correct, review, add to, or modify the award. Notably, under Section 34(4), the tribunal’s powers, though confined, remain nonetheless substantial. (Para 60\)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34(4)** \- SC disagreed the view taken in Kinnari Mullick (supra), which insists that an application or request under Section 34(4) must be made by a party in writing. The request may be oral.oral. Nevertheless, there should be a request which is recorded by the court. (Para 62\)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34(4),37-**Section 37 court still possesses the power of remand stipulated in Section 34(4). Of course, the appellate court, while exercising power under Section 37, should be mindful when the award has been upheld by the Section 34 court. But the Section 37 court still possesses the jurisdiction to remand the matter to the arbitral tribunal. (Para 62\)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34, 37-**Section 37 (Annexure A) permits an appeal against any order setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34\. To this extent, the appellate jurisdiction under Section 37 is coterminous with, and as broad as, the jurisdiction of the court deciding objections under Section 34\. (Para 62\)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section 34**\- The jurisdiction conferred under Section 34 does not distinguish between statutory and non-statutory arbitration in terms of the scope of courts’ power of review. (Para 70\)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section** **34** \- **Post Award Settlements \-** The parties are entitled to enter into an agreement or settlement even after an award is pronounced. Such a settlement should be in accordance with the provisions of Order XXIII of the Code. The law of the land does not bar the parties from entering into a post award or post decree settlement. The only legal requirement is that such settlement must be verifiable and in accordance with law i.e., the settlement is not a result of undue influence, force, fraud, coercion, etc. (Para 80\)  
**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996- Section** **43(4)** \- Section 43(4) provides liberty for the parties to invoke either arbitration or court proceedings, as applicable, following the annulment of the award- the period between the commencement of arbitration and the Court’s order setting aside the award is excluded for the purposes of calculating the limitation period under the Limitation Act, 1963\. In essence, the time during which the award is in force is not counted. (Para 81\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 227 ; Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order VII Rule 11** \- Can the High Court in exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 reject a plaint? SC held that High Court erred in law invoking the supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution to reject the plaint and observed: Civil Procedure Code is a self-contained Code and Order VII Rule 11 therein enumerates the circumstances in which the trial court may reject a plaint. Such rejection amounts to a deemed decree which is appealable before the High Court under Section 96 of the Code. This statutory scheme cannot be upended by invoking supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 to entertain a prayer for rejection of plaint. (Para 10\) Essence of the power under Article 227 being supervisory, it cannot be invoked to usurp the original jurisdiction of the court which it seeks to supervise. Nor can it be invoked to supplant a statutory legal remedy under the Civil Procedure Code, 1908\. (Para 9\)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 227** \-Power of the High Court under Article 227 is supervisory and is exercised to ensure courts and tribunals under its supervision act within the limits of their jurisdiction conferred by law. This power is to be sparingly exercised in cases where errors are apparent on the face of record, occasioning grave injustice by the court or tribunal assuming jurisdiction which it does not have, failing to exercise jurisdiction which it does have, or exercising its jurisdiction in a perverse manner. (Para 8\)  
**Procedural law \-** Procedural law provides the necessary legal infrastructure on which edifice of rule of law is built. Short-circuiting of procedure to reach hasty outcomes is an undesirable propensity of an overburdened judiciary. Such impulses rendering procedural safeguards and substantive rights otiose, subvert certainty and consistency in law and need to be discouraged. (Para 14\)

**Indian Penal Code 1860 \- Section 306-** Merely because the act of an accused is highly insulting to the deceased by using abusive language would not by itself constitute abetment of suicide. There should be evidence suggesting that the accused intended by such act to instigate the deceased to commit suicide- The essential ingredients of the offense under Section 306 IPC are (i) the abetment; (ii) intention of the accused to aid and instigate or abet the deceased to commit suicide (Para 15\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482-** The Court would not hesitate to exercise its extraordinary powers which are inherent to quash such proceedings when it comes to fore, and the court is satisfied that allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of process of Court or that the ends of the justice require that the proceedings ought to be quashed.

**Unauthorized Constructions \-** A person who has no regards for the law cannot be permitted to pray for regularisation after putting up unauthorised construction of two floors. This has something to do with the rule of law. Unauthorised construction has to be demolished. There is no way out. Judicial discretion would be guided by expediency. Courts are not free from statutory fetters. Justice is to be rendered in accordance with law \- the Courts must adopt a strict approach while dealing with cases of illegal construction and should not readily engage themselves in judicial regularisation of buildings erected without requisite permissions of the competent authority. The need for maintaining such a firm stance emanates not only from inviolable duty cast upon the Courts to uphold the rule of law, rather such judicial restraint gains more force in order to facilitate the well-being of all concerned. The law ought not to come to rescue of those who flout its rigours as allowing the same might result in flourishing the culture of impunity. Put otherwise, if the law were to protect the ones who endeavour to disregard it, the same would lead to undermine the deterrent effect of laws, which is the cornerstone of a just and orderly society.

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order I Rule 10(2) \-** The plaintiff, being dominus litis, may choose the persons against whom he wishes to litigate and seek relief, yet this rule of impleadment would be subject to the provisions of Order I Rule 10(2) wherein courts are vested with the discretion to strike out or add parties to a suit depending on whether their impleadment is deemed necessary or proper- If a party is found to either a necessary or proper party, the court would have the jurisdiction to implead him, even against the wishes of the plaintiff concerned (Para 22-24) \- Order I Rule 10(2) CPC did not pertain to the ‘right’ of a non-party to be impleaded as a party but deals with the ‘judicial discretion’ of the court to strike out or add parties at any stage of the proceeding. In exercising this judicial discretion, courts must act according to reason and fair play and not according to whims and caprice- The court may exercise discretion in impleading a person who is a ‘proper party’ upon an application by a non-party to the suit for specific performance. If the court is of the view that the impleadment of such a proper party will alter the nature of the suit or introduce a new cause of action, it may either refuse to implead such person or order for his impleadment on certain conditions. However, even otherwise, the court would not be precluded from impleading a ‘proper party’ unconditionally in its discretion. (Para 28-29) \- Referred to Mumbai International Airport (P) Ltd. v. Regency Convention Centre & Hotels (P) Ltd., reported in (2010) 7 SCC 417-A party who is seeking impleadment may not be a necessary party but still, could be termed as a proper party. There is a fine distinction between a necessary party and a proper party. A necessary party is a person in whose absence no effective decree could be passed at all by the court. Whereas a proper party is one who though not a necessary party is a person whose presence would enable the court to effectively and adequately adjudicate upon all matters in dispute in the suit.

**Specific Relief Act 1963- Section 22-** The relief of refund of earnest money under Section 2 2(1)(b) is not a relief that automatically flows from a decree for specific performance of a sale agreement and must, therefore, be explicitly sought- The plaint may be amended at any stage of the proceedings to enable the plaintiff to seek an alternative relief, including that of refund of earnest money, and the courts have been vested with wide judicial discretion to permit such amendments. However, the courts cannot grant such relief suo moto, since the inclusion of the prayer clause remains a sine qua non for the grant of such a relief. In other words, when an “appropriate case” exists for seeking the said relief under this provision, it must be specifically sought either in the original plaint or by way of an amendment.

**Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 \- Section 2(c)(i) \-** Stamp vendors across the country, by virtue of performing an important public duty and receiving remuneration from the Government for the discharge of such duty, are undoubtedly public servants within the ambit of Section 2(c)(i) of the PC Act. (Para 68.3)

**Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 \- Section 2(c)(i) \-**The definition of “public servant” as defined under the PC Act should be given a purposive and wide interpretation so as to advance the object underlying the statute- It is the nature of duty being discharged by a person which assumes paramount importance when determining whether such a person falls within the ambit of the definition of public servant as defined under the PC Act. (Para 68.1-68.2) A person would be a public servant under Section 2(c)(i) of the PC Act if he is: 1\. in the service of the Government; or 2\. in the pay of the Government; 3\. remunerated by fees or commission for the performance of any public duty-.All three categories are independent of each other. There may be cases where more than one of the aforesaid categories are applicable and “or” may be read as “and”, however, the present case does not warrant such reading. (Para 17-18)

**Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 \- Section 7,13-** Mere possession and recovery of tainted currency notes from a public servant, in the absence of proof of demand, is not sufficient to establish an offence under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) of the PC Act respectively- without evidence of demand for illegal gratification, it cannot be said that the public servant used corrupt or illegal means, or abused his position, to obtain any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage.(Para 55\)

**Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 \- Section 20-**Presumption is drawn only qua the offence under Sections 7 and 11 respectively and not qua the offence under Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act. The presumption is contingent upon the proof of acceptance of illegal gratification to the effect that the gratification was demanded and accepted as a motive or reward as contemplated under Section 7 of the PC Act. Such proof of acceptance can follow only when the demand is proved. The presumption under Section 20 arises once it is established that the public servant accepted the gratification. However, in determining whether such acceptance occurred, the totality of the evidence led at the trial must be appreciated. The evidence led by the prosecution, the suggestions made by the defence witnesses, if any, the entire record is required to be considered. Only if the cumulative effect of all the evidence is such that the sole possible conclusion is that the public servant accepted the gratification can it be said that the prosecution has established its case beyond reasonable doubt. (Para 64- 66\)

**Interpretation of Statutes-** Where the wording of a statutory provision indicates that the legislature has consciously attributed varying degrees of significance to different interpretative elements such as the nature of the relationship or the duty performed, the courts are obliged to adhere to that legislative determination and interpret the provision in a manner that reflects the intended statutory scheme. While interpreting a statute, it is essential not only to consider the words used but also to examine the Statement of Objects and Reasons, as it provides the background against which the legislation was enacted- It is an important rule of interpretation that every interpretation of a statute must be undertaken by considering the statute in its entirety, the prior state of the law, other statutes in pari materia, the general scope and purpose of the legislation, and the mischief that the legislature intended to address. (Para 43-44) The interpretation of a definition should not only avoid being repugnant to the context but it should also be interpreted to achieve the purpose which is sought to be served by the statute. A construction which would defeat or may likely defeat the purpose of the Act has to be ignored and not accepted. A definition, like any other word in a statute, has to be read in the light of the context and scheme of the Act. (Para 39\)

**Contempt of Courts Act 1971-** Creating fake orders of the Court is one of the most dreaded acts of contempt of court. It not only thwarts the administration of justice, but it has inbuilt intention by committing forgery of record. (Para 16\) The sole object of the Court wielding its power to punish for contempt is always for maintaining the purity of administration of justice. Nothing is more incumbent upon the courts of justice than to preserve their proceedings from being misrepresented, nor is there anything more pernicious when the order of the court is forged and produced to gain undue advantage. A misleading or a wrong statement deliberately and wilfully made by a party to the proceedings to obtain a favourable order would undoubtedly tantamount to interference with the due course of judicial proceedings. When a person is found to have utilised an order of a court which he or she knows to be incorrect for conferring benefit on persons who are not entitled to the same, the very utilisation of the fabricated order by the person concerned would be sufficient to hold him/her guilty of contempt, irrespective of the fact whether he or she himself or herself is the author of fabrication. (Para 8\)

**Contempt of Courts Act 1971- Section 20** \- The contempt action must be initiated either by filing of an application or by the Court issuing notice suo motu within a period of one year from the date on which the contempt is alleged to have been committed. The originating point for calculating the period of limitation has been \- (Para 14\) the date of initiation of suo motu contempt action is regarded as the initiation by the Court for the purpose of Section 20\.

**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC) \- Section 30** \- If the Resolution Plan does not comply with mandatory requirements and such plan is approved by the CoC, it could not be said that the CoC had exercised its commercial wisdom while approving such Resolution Plan. (Para 73\) Merely because the Code is silent with regard to the phase of implementation of the Resolution Plan by the Successful Resolution Applicant, neither the Tribunal nor the Courts should give excessive leeway to the Successful Resolution Applicant to act in flagrant violation of the terms of the Resolution Plan or in a lackadaisical manner. (Para 82\)  
**Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PMLA) \-Companies Act 408,410 \- IBC \- Section 31,60-** The PMLA being a Public Law, the NCLAT did not have any power or jurisdiction to review the decision of the Statutory Authority under the PMLA. (Para 30\) Neither the NCLT nor the NCLAT is vested with the powers of judicial review over the decision taken by the Government or Statutory Authority in relation to a matter which is in the realm of Public Law \- wherever the Corporate Debtor has to exercise a right that falls outside the purview of the IBC, especially in the realm of the public law, they cannot take a bypass and go before NCLT for the enforcement of such a right- NCLAT also, being an Appellate Authority under Section 61 over the orders passed by the NCLT, could not exercise any power or jurisdiction beyond Section 61 of IBC. (Para 27\)  
**IBC \- Section 62** \- The use of the phrase “any person aggrieved” indicates that there is no rigid locus requirement to institute an Appeal challenging the order of NCLT before the NCLAT, or an order of NCLAT before this Court. Any person who is aggrieved by the order may institute an Appeal. Once the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is initiated, the proceedings are no longer restricted to any individual Applicant Creditor or to the Corporate Debtor, but rather they become collective proceedings in rem, where all the creditors and the Ex- Directors would be necessary stakeholders. Therefore, the Appellants who are the operational creditors, and the erstwhile Promoters, being important stakeholders, and whose Company Appeals have been dismissed by the NCLAT vide the impugned judgment, would certainly be the persons aggrieved entitled to file Appeals before this Court under Section 62 of the IBC.  
**IBC \- Section 29A-** eligibility/ineligibility of the Resolution Applicant to submit the Resolution Plan goes to the root of the matter, it was incumbent on the part of the Resolution Professional to verify and certify that the contents of the mandatory affidavit, filed by the Resolution Applicant-JSW in respect of Section 29A were in order. (Para 23\)  
**IBC \- Section 12** \- The provision contained in Section 12(1) is mandatory in nature as the expression “shall be completed” is used. (Para 46\)  
**IBC \- Section 31,61-** For filing an Appeal under Section 61, there has to be an order passed by the NCLT so far as sub-section (1) is concerned, and if the Appeal is filed against the order of NCLT approving the Resolution Plan under Section 31, it could be filed only on the grounds mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 61\.

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order 1 Rule 8** \- Grant of leave under Order 1 Rule 8 is not prerequisite for grant of interim reliefs since the permission under the said rule can be granted at any stage of the proceedings- While filing of application it is not a mandatory pre- condition for the institution of a suit or for the granting of interim relief, it is a procedural requirement that cannot be disregarded altogether which bears upon the binding nature of any orders issued. Therefore, while the absence of Order 1 Rule 8 is a curable defect, its compliance remains crucial to ensure the enforceability and representative effect of the orders passed. (Para 62-63)

**Constitution of India \- Article 14,16,21 \- Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 \-** Reasonable accommodation is not a matter of charity but a fundamental right flowing from Articles 14, 16, and 21 of our Constitution. When administrative authorities create arbitrary barriers that exclude qualified PwBD candidates, they not only violate statutory provisions but also perpetuate the historical injustice and stigmatisation. The fundamental rights and the dignity of PwD and PwBD candidates must be protected by ensuring that assessment of their capabilities is individualised, evidence-based, and free from stereotypical assumptions that have no scientific foundation. (Para 15\) \- No deserving candidate in the PwBD category is denied admission into the MBBS course in spite of his/her/their entitlement.

This power can be exercised even at the stage of writing a judgment by the court. It is, however, proper that this power should not be exercised lightly and the rule is that it should be used sparingly and in exceptional cases only. The power is to be used for removing ambiguities, for clarifying the statement and not for the purposes of filling up the lacuna in a party's case. It is true that the power can be exercised by the Court at its own initiative and may even be so done at the instance of a party.

A decade or two earlier, live-in relationships might not have been common. But now more and more women are financially independent and have the capacity to take conscious decision of charting their life on their own terms. This financial freedom, inter alia, has led to proliferation of such live-in relationships. Therefore, when a matter of this nature comes to a court, it must not adopt a pedantic approach rather the Court may, based on the length of such relationship and conduct of the parties, presume implied consent of the parties to be in such a relationship regardless of their desire or a wish to convert it into a marital bond.

**Land Acquisition \-** Adacent lands or villages possessing similar potential and advantages must be compensated equitably, unless distinctions are clearly and substantially justified. (Para 14\) The ‘**belting method’** is a recognized technique in land acquisition whereby the land is divided into distinct zones based on its proximity to key infrastructural assets, such as a National Highway. This method operates on the principle that lands closer to such assets inherently possess greater market potential and thus warrant a higher compensation as compared to those situated further away. In essence, it constitutes an exception to the general rule of uniformity in awarding equitable compensation. Typically, the belting method is applied in large-scale acquisitions where the land is non-homogeneous and the benefits of proximity to major infrastructure can be clearly delineated- the belting method must be grounded in objective evidence of differential developmental potential. (Para 22-23) The ‘**comparable sales method’** as perhaps the best mode of determining compensation for an acquired land. While the reasons for this may be manifold, it seems to us that the advantage of using the comparable sales method in land acquisition is that it provides the Court with tangible, real-world examples of transactions, eliminating the need for speculation about how a willing buyer and seller might negotiate a price- comparable sale deeds may only be considered if they pre-date the Section 4 Notification, which would consequently be truly reflective of the market value of the acquired land at the relevant time. (Para 28-30) **Development cut \-** To determine the market value of a large tract of undeveloped agricultural land (with potential for development) from a sale exemplar of a smaller plot of land, deductions usually range from 20 to 75%. 20 That is not to say, however, that such cuts are mandatory in all factual scenarios. The rationale for applying such deductions is that smaller, developed plots typically command higher prices, whereas a larger tract of undeveloped land necessitates significant allocation for roads, parks, and essential services. These sale exemplars can thus be relied upon only after making appropriate deductions.

**Service Law \- Army** \-If any action is taken by the authority for the discharge of a serviceman and the serviceman is denied disability pension on the basis of a report of the Medical Board wherein no reasons have been disclosed for the opinion so given, such an action of the authority will be unsustainable in law- There is a difference between the “conclusion” or “opinion”, and “reasons” to support such a conclusion or opinion. The reasons have to be separately mentioned for the conclusion arrived at by the Medical Board. The bare conclusion arrived by the Medical Board cannot treated as the reasons for discharge of the serviceman and denial of invalid pension within the meaning of the Regulations. (Para 25-26)

**Regulation for Medical Services for Armed Forces \- Regulation 423:** 1\. It is immaterial whether the cause giving rise to the disability or death occurred in an area declared to be a field service/active service area or under normal peace conditions- 2.It is, however, essential to establish that the disability or death bore a casual connection with the service conditions. 3\. All evidence, both direct and circumstantial, will be taken into account and benefit of reasonable doubt, if any, will be given to the individual. 4\. A disease which has led to an individual's discharge or death will ordinarily be deemed to have arisen in service if no note of it was made at the time of the individual's acceptance for service in the armed forces. 5\. However, if the medical opinion holds, for reasons to be stated that the disease could not have been detected on medical examination prior to acceptance for service, the disease will not be deemed to have arisen during service. 6\. The question, whether a disability or death is attributable to or aggravated by service or not, will be decided as regards its medical aspects by a Medical Board or by the medical officer who signs the certificate. The Medical Board/medical officer will specify reasons for their/his opinion. 7\. The opinion of the Medical Board/medical officer, insofar as it relates to the actual cause of the disability or death and the circumstances in which it originated will be regarded as final. 8\. The question whether the cause and the attendant circumstances can be attributed to service will, however, be decided by the pension sanctioning authority. 9\. To assist the medical officer who signs the death certificate or the Medical Board in the case of an invalid, the CO unit will furnish a report on: (i) AFMS F-81 : in all cases other than those due to injuries. (ii) IAFY 2006 : in all cases of injuries other than battle injuries. (Para 17\)

**PMLA 2002 \- Section 44(1)(b) ; Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 204 \[BNSS \- Section 227\] \-** Section 204 of the CrPC (Section 227 of the BNSS) is applicable to a complaint under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA. (Para 25\) Once cognizance is taken on the basis of a complaint under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA, the learned Special Judge must direct that along with the process, a copy of the complaint and the following documents be provided to the accused; (i) Statements recorded by the learned Special Judge of the complainant and the witnesses, if any, before taking cognizance; (ii) The documents including the copies of the Statements under Section 50 of the PMLA produced before the Special Court, along with the complaint, and the documents produced subsequently by the ED till the date of taking cognizance; and (iii) Copies of the supplementary complaints and the documents, if any, produced with supplementary complaints- (c) A copy of the list of statements, documents, material objects and exhibits that are not relied upon by the investigating officer must also be furnished to the accused. the object is to ensure that the accused has knowledge of the documents, objects, etc. in the custody of the investigating officer which are not relied upon so that at the appropriate stage, the accused can apply by invoking the provisions of Section 91 of the CrPC (Section 94 of the BNSS) for providing copies of the documents which are not relied upon by the prosecution. (Para 30\)  
**PMLA Act** \-At the time of hearing for framing of charge, reliance can be placed only on the documents forming part of the chargesheet. In case of the PMLA, at the time of framing charge, reliance can be placed only on those documents which are produced along with the complaint or supplementary complaints. Though the accused will be entitled to a list of documents, objects, exhibits etc. that are not relied upon by the ED at the stage of framing of charge, in ordinary course, the accused is not entitled to seek copies of the said documents at the stage of framing of charge. (Para 55\)  
**PMLA Act ; Code of Criminal Procedure \- Section 233** \-At the stage of entering upon defence, an accused can apply for the issue of process for the production of any document or thing in accordance with Section 233(3) of the CrPC (Section 256(3) of the BNSS). At this stage, he can also apply for the production of a document or a thing that is in the custody of the prosecution but has not been produced. A fair trial is a part of the right guaranteed to an accused under Article 21 of the Constitution. The right to a fair trial of the accused includes the right to defend. The right to defend consists of the right to lead the defence evidence by examining the witnesses and producing the documents. Therefore, the accused is entitled to exercise his right at the stage of entering upon defence by compelling the prosecution or a third party to produce a document or a thing in their possession or custody. The Court can decline the request of the accused for issuing process for the production of documents only on the limited grounds set out in sub-section (3) of section 233 of the CrPC (f) When at the stage of defence evidence of the accused, documents are produced on the prayer of the accused and the accused desires to cross-examine any of the prosecution witnesses based on the said documents, it is always open for the accused to apply under Section 311 of the CrPC (Section 348 of the BNSS) to recall a prosecution witness already examined for further cross-examination. The reason is that the right to effectively cross-examine the prosecution witnesses is also a part of the right to have a fair trial. The accused can exercise this right even if evidence of both sides is closed. (Para 55\)  
**PMLA \- Section 45 ; Code of Criminal Procedure \- Section 91 \-** At the time of hearing of an application for bail governed by Section 45(1)(ii) in connection with the offences under Section 3 of the PMLA, an accused is entitled to invoke Section 91 of the CrPC (Section 94 of the BNSS) seeking production of unrelied upon documents. If investigation or further investigation in progress, the ED is entitled to raise objection to production of documents sought by the accused on the ground that if the documents are disclosed at this stage to the accused, it may prejudice the investigation. Only if the Court after perusing the documents is satisfied that the disclosure of the documents at that stage may prejudice the ongoing investigation, it can deny the prayer for the production of such documents. (Para 55\)  
**PMLA \- Section 2(w) \-** Deeds and instruments of title are included in the definition of property and books or records stored in a computer become records within the meaning of Section 2(w). (Para 14\)  
**PMLA \- Section 20 \-** The order of retention of the property under Section 20 does not amount to forfeiture of the property. The seized property does not vest in the ED. There is no prohibition on providing copies of the deeds or instruments evidencing title to the person from whom or from whose premises the deeds or instruments are seized. If the provision is interpreted to mean that the person from whom such deeds or instruments are seized is not entitled to receive even copies of the same, the provision will be rendered arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. (Para 18\)  
**Code of Criminal Procedure \- Section 173(6) \[BNSS- Section 193(7)\] \- A**fter the charge sheet is filed, the accused is entitled to copies of the police report, FIR, confessions, statements, if any, recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC, and statements recorded under sub-section (3) of Section 161 of the CrPC of all the persons whom the prosecution proposes to examine as witnesses. There is an exception to the rule as regards the supply of statements under Section 161(3) of the CrPC. Sub-section (6) of Section 173 (sub-section (7) of Section 193 of the BNSS) provides that if the police officer is of the opinion that any part of such statement is not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding or that its disclosure to the accused is not essential in the interest of justice and is inexpedient in public interest, he shall indicate that part of the statement and append a note requesting the learned Magistrate to exclude that part of the statement from the copies to be provided to the accused. The police officer is required to state reasons for making such a request. As can be seen from the first proviso to Section 207 of the CrPC, after considering the request of the police officer and the reasons given by him, it is open for the learned Magistrate to direct a copy of that part of the statement or such portion thereof as the learned Magistrate thinks proper, to be furnished to the accused. However, the learned Magistrate is not bound by the request made by the police officer. After considering the request, the learned Magistrate is empowered to reject the request of the police officer and supply the complete copies of such statements. It is pertinent to note that the Police have the power to apply for the exclusion of parts of only the statements. This power does not extend to the documents covered by clause (v) of Section 207\.

**Constitution of India \- Article 32,226 \-** Each branch of the State in a democracy, be it the legislature, executive or the judiciary, especially in a constitutional democracy, acts within the framework of the Constitution. It is the Constitution that is higher than all of us. It is the Constitution which imposes limits and restrictions on the powers vested in the three organs. The power of judicial review is conferred by the Constitution on the judiciary. Statutes are subject to judicial review to test their constitutionality as well as for judicial interpretation. Therefore, when the constitutional courts exercise their power of judicial review, they act within the framework of the Constitution. (Para 7\) Judicial decisions are made in accordance with legal principles and not in keeping with political, religious or community considerations. When citizens approach the court praying for exercise of the power of judicial review, they do so in furtherance of their fundamental and/or legal rights. The court’s consideration of such a prayer is the fulfilment of its constitutional duty. (Para 9\)  
**Constitution of India \- Article 19 \-** Judicial pronouncements result in an order or a decision which may aggrieve a party or sometimes a section of the public. Critical analysis and objective criticism of an order’s reasoning or even its outcome is protected under the fundamental right to free speech and expression under clause (a) of Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India. (Para 3\)  
**Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 \-** Exercise of the power of contempt is discretionary. (Para 3\) when criticism is an obvious distortion or a gross misstatement, which is made in a manner designed to lower the respect of the judiciary and destroy public confidence, it should not be ignored. However, the power to initiate contempt is discretionary in its unsheathed exercise. Every commission of contempt need not erupt in an indignant committal or levy of punishment, however deserving it may actually be. It is so because judges are judicious, their valour non-violent and their wisdom springs into action when played upon by a volley of values, the least of which is personal protection. Courts believe in values like free press, fair trial, judicial fearlessness and community confidence. Thus, courts need not protect their verdicts and decisions by taking recourse to the power of contempt. Surely, courts and judges have shoulders broad enough and an implicit trust that the people would perceive and recognize when criticism or critique is biased, scandalous and ill-intentioned. (Para 6\) \[**Context**: SC observed that Nishikant Dubey 's comments were highly irresponsible and reflect a penchant to attract attention by casting aspersions on the Supreme Court of India and the Judges of the Supreme Court.\]  
**Judiciary** \- The judiciary, as an institution, is accountable to the people through various mechanisms. Arguments take place in open court. Decisions and judgments are reasoned. Judicial procedure ensures transparency and accountability. Judgments are put to scrutiny and critique. Decisions are debated and if required, corrected by exercise of right of appeal, review, in curative jurisdiction and by reference to a larger bench. The judiciary’s legitimacy and credibility are rooted in public trust and are maintained through fair, impartial and transparent decision-making. (Para 7\)  
**Hate speech \-** that any attempt to spread communal hatred or indulge in hate speech must be dealt with an iron hand. Hate speech cannot be tolerated as it leads to loss of dignity and self-worth of the targeted group members, contributes to disharmony amongst groups, and erodes tolerance and open-mindedness, which is a must for a multi-cultural society committed to the idea of equality. Any attempt to cause alienation or humiliation of the targeted group is a criminal offence and must be dealt with accordingly.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \-** Summoning of an accused is a serious matter which affects liberty and dignity of the individual concerned. Judicial intervention under Section 482 Cr.PC to weed out vexatious proceedings is of pivotal importance in order to protect individuals from untelling harassment and misery and to ensure unmerited prosecutions do not crowd overflowing dockets of criminal courts and yield space for deserving cases. Faced with the agony of a lame prosecution, it is of little solace to a litigant to be told that inherent powers are shut out as he is entitled to approach the trial court and pray for discharge. The inherent power of the High Court to prevent abuse of process of court is much wider in amplitude than the discharge powers and cannot be whittled down on the plea of existence of such remedy.

**Constitution of India \- Article 142 \-** Exercise of power conferred by Article 142, in a case where a minimum sentence is prescribed by the statute, cannot be tinkered, for, the same would amount to legislation by the Court; and, prescription of a term of sentence quite contrary to what the Parliament has legislated would be legally impermissible. The statutory prescription in relation to punishment for a minimum period, unless challenged, cannot be reduced by this Court even in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution- It is only rarely, and in extraordinary cases, that this Court may, in the exercise of its plenary power to temper justice with mercy grant a convict a prison-term waiver. As and by way of illustration, a convict (on bail) who is too ill to understand why he needs to be sent to prison or too ill to be taken to prison or the like, could qualify for grant of extreme leniency by this Court but only on production of unimpeachable evidence to that effect. (Para 28-30)

**Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 \- Section 19 \- Sanction \-** There is a legal impediment to prosecute a public servant for corruption, if there be no sanction. Grant of sanction is an administrative function based on the subjective satisfaction of the sanctioning authority after due application of mind to the materials placed before him. Whether sanction should be granted or not is, however, not about mental satisfaction of the truth of the facts placed before the officer competent to grant sanction but all that is necessary for a sanction to be granted is for him to be satisfied about the existence of a prima facie case. (Para 11\) If a draft order is placed before the sanctioning authority and he is satisfied that nothing needs to be added/deleted therefrom, the grant of sanction cannot be faulted merely on the ground of absence of addition of words to/deletion of words from the draft.

**Judiciary and media \- Subjudice principle** \- Courts, as a public and open institution, must always remain open to public observations, debates and criticisms. Infact, courts should welcome debates and constructive criticism. Every important issue needs to be vigorously debated by the people and the press, even if the issue of debate is subjudice before a court. However, those who offer criticism should remember that Judges cannot respond to such criticism but if a publication scandalizes the court or a Judge or Judges and if a case of contempt is made out, certainly courts should take action. But it is not the duty of the court to tell the media: delete this, take that down. (Para 30\) \- For the improvement of any system and that includes the judiciary, introspection is the key. That can happen only if there is a robust debate even on issues which are before the court. Both the judiciary and the media are the foundational pillars of democracy which is a basic feature of our Constitution. For a liberal democracy to thrive, both must supplement each other. (Para 31\)  
**Contempt of Courts Act 1971 \-** If a member of the public or a litigant or for that matter even the media tries to scandalize the court by making sweeping unfounded allegations against the court or the Judge(s) or by imputing motives against the Judge or Judges who had passed a judicial order or had conducted the court proceedings, certainly the courts would be justified to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against such contemnors. This would also be a ground to direct postponement of publication as contempt of court is a reasonable restriction enumerated under Article 19(2) on the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a).

**Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963-Section 5A \- Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959 \- Section 7A** \-Constitutional Validity upheld (Para 39\) \- Sections 5A or 7A, as the case may be, impose purchase tax specifically in situations where the seller is granted exemption from payment of tax \- Exemption from payment of tax at the time of sale is a pre-condition for attracting Sections 5A and 7A respectively. Further, the fact that in case the goods were not exempt from payment of tax at the time of sale and the goods would have attracted tax at the first point of sale, is immaterial and inconsequential. Levy of purchase tax is governed by the provisions and stipulations of Sections 5A or 7A. They are independent and in a way constitute charging sections. Purchase tax is leviable on and payable by the purchaser. However, the legislations do not levy the purchase tax to tax the transaction of the sale and purchase twice. Instead, it levies purchase tax only where no sales tax was payable on the sale. Further, purchase tax has not been made leviable in all situations, except in three situations, namely, (a) where the goods on which no tax is paid were used in manufacture; or (b) where the goods were despatched out of the State other than by way of inter- State trade or commerce; or (c) where the goods are disposed of in a manner other than sale within the State. However, the need to satisfy the conditions do not change the nature of the charge, which is, tax on purchase. (Para 31\)  
**Constitution of India \- Seventh Schedule \- State List** \- the event, that is inter-State movement of the goods, which does not amount to inter-State sale, falls within the legislative domain and power of the State Legislature. The State, when it imposes such tax, does not exceed its power to impose tax conferred by the State List as inter-State sale of goods is not being subjected to tax. (Para 32\)  
**Interpretation of Statutes \- Taxation Laws \-** While examining tax provisions, we must give sufficient latitude to the Legislature. Income generation in the form of taxes is an important source of revenue for both the State and the Central governments. Some play in the joints should be given to the Legislature while dealing with laws relating to taxation and economic activities except in case of encroachment upon the power to tax that is not vested with them in terms of the Union or the State List, etc. (Para 33\)

The degree of satisfaction required under this provision has to be lower than the proof beyond reasonable doubt, but must still be rooted in material that is not inherently improbable or ex facie unreliable- The rigour of Section 43D(5) of the UAPA would, however, in an appropriate case yield to the overarching mandate of Article 21 of the Constitution, especially where the trial is inordinately delayed or where the incarceration becomes punitive.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 195** \[Section 215 BNSS\] \- The object of imposition of the bar under Section 195 CrPC is to avoid the frivolous litigation and not to provide shelter or tool to a mischief player or an offender- The scheme of the Section requires that the offence should be such which has a direct bearing on the discharge of lawful duties of a public servant or has a direct correlation with the proceedings in a Court of justice, affecting the administration of justice. \-The provision only creates a bar against taking cognizance of an offence in certain specified situations except upon complaint by the Court. vi. To attract the bar under Section 195(1)(b), the offence should have been committed when the document was in "custodia legis" or in the custody of the Court concerned- High Courts can exercise jurisdiction and power enumerated under Section 195 on an application being made to it or suo-motu, whenever the interest of justice so demands- In such a case, where the High Court as a superior Court directs a complaint to be filed in respect of an offence covered under Section \- 195(1)(b)(i), the bar for taking cognizance, will not apply.

**Senior Advocate Designation \-** Directions issued: (i) The directions contained in paragraph 73.7 of Indira Jaising-1 as amended by Indira Jaising-2 shall not be implemented; (ii) It will be appropriate if all the High Courts frame Rules in terms of what is held in this decision within a period of 4 months from today by amending or substituting the existing Rules. The Rules shall be made keeping in view the following guidelines: a. The decision to confer designation shall be of the Full Court of the High Courts or this Court; b. The applications of all candidates found to be eligible by the Permanent Secretariat along with relevant documents submitted by the applicants shall be placed before the Full House. An endeavour can always be made to arrive at consensus. However, if a consensus on designation of Advocates is not arrived at, the decision-making must be by a democratic method of voting. Whether in a given case there should be a secret ballot, is a decision which can be best left to the High Courts to take a call considering facts and circumstances of the given case; c. Minimum qualification of 10 years of practice fixed by Indira Jaising-1 needs no reconsideration; d. The practice of Advocates making applications for grant of designation can continue as the act of making application can be treated as consent of the Advocates concerned for designation. Additionally, the Full Court may consider and confer designation dehors an application in a deserving case; e. In the scheme of Section 16(2), there is no scope for individual Judges of this Court or High Courts to recommend candidate for designation; and f. At least one exercise of designation should be undertaken every calendar year. (iii) The processes already initiated on the basis of decisions of this Court in the case of Indira Jaising-1 and Indira Jaising-2 shall continue to be governed by the said decisions. However, new process shall not be initiated and new applications shall not be considered unless there is a proper regime of Rules framed by the High Courts; (iv) It is obvious that even this Court will have to undertake the exercise of amending the Rules/Guidelines in the light of this decision; and (v) Every endeavour shall be made to improve the regime/system of designation by periodically reviewing the same by this Court and the respective High Courts. (Para 87\)  
**Advocates Act 1961 \- Section 16 \-**An Act of making application will amount to consent of the Advocate for being considered for designation. Act of making such applications may not necessarily amount to soliciting the designation. The practice of allowing applications to be made has practical advantages. The educational qualifications, experience in law, field of practice, income, pro bono work, work of mentoring juniors, articles and books, writing publications, etc., are relevant in the process of designation. Instead of the Court’s Registry calling for these details, it becomes more convenient if the Advocates furnish the details along with their applications \-A deserving Advocate who does not apply can be always be designated after obtaining his consent.

**Competition Act, 2002 \- Section 4** \-An effects-based analysis is an obligatory component of every inquiry under Section 4 (Para 66); Section 4 does not per se prohibit dominance; it prohibits the abuse of dominance. Abuse, by definition, is conduct that distorts the competitive process or harms consumers. The statute therefore contemplates two logically separate findings: (i) that the impugned practice falls within one of the descriptive clauses (a)–(e) of sub-Section (2), and (ii). that it results in, or is likely to result in, an appreciable adverse effect on competition (“AAEC”). To collate the second enquiry into the first would equate description with proscription and convert the provision into a strict-liability offence. (Para 59\)  
**Competition Act, 2002 \- Section 36(2) \-** It incorporates the Code of Civil Procedure’s guarantees, including the right to “examine witnesses on oath” and to test them in cross-examination, while Regulation 41(5) of the 2009 General Regulations obliges the DG or the CCI to grant that opportunity whenever it is “necessary or expedient”. Audi alteram partem is therefore woven into the statute itself. (Para 68\)  
**Competition Act, 2002 \- Section 4(2)(a)** \- To attract Section 4(2)(a) of the Act, it must be shown that transactions which are equivalent in every commercially relevant respect are nevertheless subject to dissimilar conditions (Para 41\) An abuse arises only where a dominant enterprise “directly or indirectly imposes unfair or discriminatory…price in purchase or sale”. As the words “unfair or discriminatory” import a comparative enquiry, it must first be established that transactions which are materially equivalent have been accorded materially different treatment. If the challenged differentiation rests on an objective commercial justification, or if it is open on identical terms to every purchaser similarly placed, the price cannot be stigmatised as abusive. (Para 32\)  
**Competition Act, 2002 \-Section 4(2)(e)** \- This section proscribes the use of a dominant position in one relevant market “to enter into, or protect, another relevant market.” The classical manifestation of this is the alleged margin-squeeze: a vertically integrated firm fixes the wholesale input price so high, and its own downstream price so low, that downstream rivals, though equally efficient, cannot earn a viable margin \- Three cumulative conditions must therefore be shown: (i). The respondent must itself operate downstream; (ii). The wholesale-to-retail spread must be insufficient for an equally efficient competitor; and (iii). The compression must threaten competitive harm. (Para 48\)  
**Competition Act, 2002 \- Section 4(2)(d) \-** This section is attracted only where a dominant enterprise: (1) supplies two distinct products,(2) makes the supply of the tying product conditional upon acceptance of the tied product, and (3) thereby forecloses competitors in the tied-product market.  
**Competition Act, 2002** \- Competition law is not designed to humble the successful or to clip the wings of enterprises that have, through industry and innovation, secured a commanding share of the market. The true purpose of antitrust laws is to preserve the process of competition, i.e., to ensure that rivals may challenge the incumbent on the merits, that consumers enjoy the fruits of efficiency, and that technological progress is not stifled by artificial barriers. If mere size or success were treated as an offence, and every dominant firm exposed to sanction without tangible proof of competitive harm, the law would defeat itself: it would freeze capital formation, penalise productivity, and ultimately impoverish the very public it is meant to protect- Heavy-handed enforcement, divorced from market effects, would discourage the long-term capital and expertise the economy urgently needs. An effects- based standard is therefore not a mere procedural nicety. It is both a constitutional bulwark against arbitrary restraint of lawful enterprise and a strategic necessity if India is to capture the opportunities that more protectionist economies are in danger of forsaking.

Act (Para 11)- The term “cruelty” is subject to rather cruel misuse by the parties, and cannot be established simpliciter without specific instances, to say the least. The tendency of roping these sections, without mentioning any specific dates, time or incident, weakens the case of the prosecutions, and casts serious suspicion on the viability of the version of a Complainant (Para 14)- Growing tendency to append every relative of the husband, casts serious doubt on the veracity of the allegations made by the Complainant wife or her family members, and vitiates the very objective of a protective legislation.

Only when sufficient cause or reasons given for the delay by the litigant and the opposition of the other side is equally balanced or stand on equal footing, the court may consider the merits of the main matter for the purpose of condoning the delay- Delay should not be condoned merely as an act of generosity.

Another situation can be that the eyewitness did not know the accused before the incident. In the normal course, in case of the second situation, it is necessary to hold a Test Identification Parade. If it is not held and if the evidence of the eyewitness is recorded after a few years, the identification of such an accused by the eyewitness in the Court becomes vulnerable. Identification of the accused sitting in the Court by the eyewitness is of utmost importance. For example, if an eyewitness states in his deposition that “he had seen A, B and C killing X and he knew A, B and C”. Such a statement in the examination-in-chief is not sufficient to link the same to the accused. The eyewitness must identify the accused A, B and C in the Court. Unless this is done, the prosecution cannot establish that the accused are the same persons who are named by the eyewitness in his deposition. If an eyewitness states that “he had seen one accused assaulting the deceased with a sword, another accused assaulting the deceased with a stick and another accused holding the deceased to enable other accused to assault the deceased.” In such a case, the eyewitness must identify the accused in the open Court who, according to him, had assaulted the accused with a stick, who had assaulted the deceased with a sword and who was holding the deceased. Unless the eyewitnesses identify the accused present in the Court, it cannot be said that, based on the testimony of the eyewitnesses, the guilt of the accused has been proved. (Para 21\)

There is no element of discretion left in the court or judicial authority to obviate the legislative mandate of compelling parties to seek recourse to arbitration \- Allegations of fraud or criminal wrongdoing or of statutory violation would not detract from the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to resolve a dispute arising out of a civil or contractual relationship on the basis of the jurisdiction conferred by the arbitration agreement.

It cannot be said that he had control over all the children in the School. He may have control over the management of the institution which runs the School. That does not give him control over every child studying in the school. While considering the applicability of Section 75 of the JJ Act, we are not concerned with the moral responsibility of the school's management.

**Employment Contracts** \- Restrictive covenant prescribing a minimum term cannot be said to be unconscionable, unfair or unreasonable and thereby in contravention of public policy. \[Context: SC held that the restrictive covenant in clause 11(k) of the appointment letter issued by Vijaya Bank does not amount to restraint of trade nor is it opposed to public policy.\]

**Indian Contract Act 1872 \- Section 27 \-** A restrictive covenant operating during the subsistence of an employment contract does not put a clog on the freedom of a contracting party to trade or employment- In this case, the relevant clause was to work for a minimum term i.e. three years and in default to pay liquidated damages of Rs. 2 Lakhs. SC held: The clause sought to impose a restriction on the respondent’s option to resign and thereby perpetuated the employment contract for a specified term. The object of the restrictive covenant was in furtherance of the employment contract and not to restrain future employment. Hence, it cannot be said to be violative of Section 27 of the Contract Act.

**Standard form employment contracts \-** Interpretation of standard form employment contracts may be summarized as follows:- (i) Standard form employment contracts prima facie evidence unequal bargaining power. (ii) Whenever the weaker party to such a contract pleads undue influence/coercion or alleges that the contract or any term thereof is opposed to public policy, the Court shall examine such plea keeping in mind the unequal status of the parties and the context in which the contractual obligations were created. (iii) The onus to prove that a restrictive covenant in an employment contract is not in restraint of lawful employment or is not opposed to public policy, is on the covenantee i.e. the employer and not on the employee. (Para 21\)

**Public Policy** \- Generally speaking, public policy relates to matters involving public good and public interest. What is ‘just, fair and reasonable’ in the eyes of society varies with time. Civilizational advancements, growth of knowledge and evolving standards of human rights and dignity alter the contours of public good and policy. From the prism of employer-employee relationship, technological advancements impacting nature and character of work, re-skilling and preservation of scarce specialized workforce in a free market are emerging heads in the public policy domain which need to be factored when terms of an employment contract is tested on the anvil of public policy.

### 

**Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 \- Section 7 \-** A dispute resolution clause may only rise to the level of a valid arbitration clause or agreement when it signifies a clear intent to arbitrate, entails a binding adjudicatory process, and contemplates compliance with general arbitral norms. i. Clear Intent to Arbitrate The agreement must reflect a definitive and mutual intention to refer disputes to arbitration, excluding the jurisdiction of civil courts in respect of such matters. Consensus ad-idem or ‘meeting of the minds’ of the respective parties towards settling any disputes that may arise between them through the process of arbitration must be made out from the form and substance of the legal agreement or contract. This ideally entails the parties reducing their intention of entering into an arbitration agreement into some tangible medium. ii. Binding Adjudicatory Process The arbitration agreement must contemplate a binding and enforceable resolution of disputes. The process must culminate in a final and conclusive award, not a non-binding recommendation or mediation outcome. In essence, the result of the arbitral process should be final and binding on both the parties- iii. Compliance with Arbitration Norms While the statutory minimums do not universally require specification of seat, venue, or applicable procedural rules, best practices and several foreign jurisdictions encourage clarity in these respects to ensure legal certainty. The agreement should allow for party autonomy in the appointment of arbitrators and procedural conduct, subject to statutory safeguards. The adversarial process, which inheres in the institution of arbitration, must also be given due credence via provision for an impartial adjudicatory body, whose decisions involve deference to the principles of natural justice- The aforementioned elemental test is a conjunctive one, and not a disjunctive one \-All the elements identified hereinabove must co-exist, apart from being duly proven by the party which seeks to assert that an arbitration agreement subsists. (Para 30-33) While it is true that an arbitration clause must result in a conclusive determination, finality alone does not equate it to arbitration.(Para 39\) 

**Practice and Procedure \- Arbitration \-** Courts or judicial fora of our country—as a matter of judicial best policy—must show an unwavering tendency towards rejecting shoddily drafted clauses at the very threshold. Such cases, which prima facie disclose mala fides woven into the very Agreement they seek adjudication over, must be thrown out of the Court, as they have been indulged for far too long. We would complementarily urge the Courts to invoke their suo moto powers in appropriate cases wherein legal firms or counsel are found designing ‘arbitration clauses’ which deliberately mislead and misguide. The time is not far when personal liability must be assigned for such unscrupulous acts, along with the sanctioning of the harshest punitive measures against the actors. We are confident that these steps are vital to infuse probity, transparency, and professionalism into Indian arbitration. Needless to say, to uphold the integrity of the arbitral process, the sanctity of such agreements must be preserved. (Para 59\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 142 \-**while exercising the powers under Article 142, the express provisions in the other relevant Statutes should not be ignored, particularly when the exercise of powers under Article 142, would directly be in conflict with what has been express provisions in such Statutes (Para 19\) The exercise of power under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India being curative in nature, the Supreme Court would not ordinarily pass an order ignoring or disregarding a statutory provisions governing the subject, except to balance the equities between conflicting claims of the litigating parties by ironing out creases in a “cause or matter” before it. Therefore, even while exercising the powers under Article 142, the Supreme Court has to take note of the express provisions of any substantive statutory law and accordingly regulate the exercise of its power and discretion to do complete justice between the parties in the pending “cause or matter” arising out of such statutes. Though, the powers of this Court cannot be controlled by any statutory provisions, when the exercise of powers under Article 142 comes directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided in a statute, ordinarily, such power should not be exercised. Article 142 cannot be used to achieve something indirectly what cannot be achieved directly. (Para 13\)

In view of such distribution of Legislative powers, situations have arisen where two legislative fields have apparently overlapped. In such situations, this Court has held that it would be the duty of the courts to ascertain as to what degree and to what extent, the authority to deal with the matters falling within these classes of subjects exists in each of such legislatures, and to define the limits of their respective powers.

**Forest Conservation Act, 1980 \- Section 2-** Neither the State Government nor any other authority can make an order or issue a direction for de-reservation of reserved forest or any portion thereof or permit use of any forest land or any portion thereof for any non-forest purpose. Neither is it permissible to assign any forest land or any portion thereof by way of lease or otherwise to any private person or to any authority, corporation, agency or organization not owned, managed or controlled by the Government except after obtaining prior approval of the Central Government- **Directions issued:** Chief Secretaries of all the States and the Administrators of all the Union Territories to constitute Special Investigation Teams for the purpose of examining as to whether any of the reserved Forest Land in the possession of the Revenue Department has been allotted to any private individuals/institutions for any purpose other than the forestry purpose;- The State Governments and the Union Territories directed to take steps to take back the possession of the land from the persons/institutions in possession of such lands and handover the same to the Forest Department. In case, it is found that taking back the possession of the land would not be in the larger public interest, the State Governments/Union Territories should recover the cost of the said land from the persons/institutions to whom they were allotted and use the said amount for the purpose of development of forests \- Chief Secretaries of all the States and the Administrators of all the Union Territories to constitute Special Teams to ensure that all such transfers take place within a period of one year from today- Such land should be used only for the purpose of afforestation.

**Criminal Trial \- Circumstantial Evidence \-** The prosecution has to prove the entire chain of incriminating circumstances by adducing unimpeachable evidence, which leads to only one hypothesis that is consistent with the guilt of the accused, inconsistent with his innocence or the guilt of anyone else. The chain of circumstances sought to be relied upon by the prosecution must be complete in all aspects and must unerringly link the accused with the crime. In case of any breach in the chain of incriminating circumstances, the Court would be left with no option but to acquit the accused by giving him the benefit of doubt. (Para 31\) \[**Context**: SC acquits man who was concurrently convicted and sentenced to death for rape and murder of minor girl\]

**Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954** \- The benefit that the Probation Act envisages is inapplicable to an offence committed under the PoFA Act, if the offence has been committed between introduction of Section 20AA in 1976 and its repeal in 2006 by the FSS Act. (Para 41\)

**Interpretation of Statutes \- Criminal Laws** \- Is mollification of a punishment on the ground that the new enactment provides for a lesser punishment permissible ?- A ‘repeals and savings’ clause in any statute is not mere surplusage that the Courts may ignore in the interpretation of the law. When a ‘repeal and savings’ clause specifically protects a penalty provided for in the old enactment, the intention of the legislature is clear. This Court, in its enthusiasm, cannot and should not provide a benefit to the accused that is not permitted in law. Mollification must only be provided in cases where a provision in relation to ‘repeal and savings’ is either not present or where the ‘repeal and savings’ clause envisages such a possibility. (Para 43\) \-The benefit of mollification of sentence cannot be given when a ‘repeal and savings’ clause in the repealing statute expressly saves a penalty incurred under the repealed statute. (Para 48\)

**Sentencing** \- Difference between reduction or mollification of a sentence and releasing an offender on probation \- The probationary process envisages that first time offenders who are capable of reformation can be provided a benefit such that they can continue to a be a part of society as capable and law-abiding citizens in the future. The thrust of penology in the past few decades has been focused on the reformation of an individual. “Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future”. (Para 41\)

### [**Mohit Kumar vs State Of Uttar Pradesh 2025 INSC 704 \- Public Employment \- Advertisement \- Caste Status**](https://www.caseciter.com/mohit-kumar-vs-state-of-uttar-pradesh-2025-insc-704-public-employment-advertisement-caste-status/)

**Public Employment \- Advertisement \-** The terms of an advertisement issued in connection with a selection process are normally not open to challenge unless the challenge is founded on the ground of breach of Article 16 of the Constitution or, for that matter, Article 14\. Once an advertisement is issued inviting applications for public employment, it is the responsibility, nay duty, of an aspirant to read and note the terms and understand what its requirements are. If any aspirant finds any of the terms ambiguous and there is scope for an inquiry inbuilt in the advertisement or is provided by any rule/regulation, an effort ought to be first made to obtain clarity for understanding the requirements accurately. If no such scope is available, nothing prevents the aspirant from seeking clarity by making a representation. Should such clarity be not provided, the aspirant may participate in the process without prejudice to his rights and may question the term even after he is not selected. However, if the aspirant does not make any such effort and takes a calculated chance of selection based on his own understanding of the disputed term in the advertisement and later, he emerges unsuccessful, ordinarily, it would not be open to him to challenge the selection on the ground that the disputed term is capable of being understood differently. In such cases, the courts should be loath to entertain such plea of ambiguity while preferring to accept the recruiting authority’s understanding of the said term. This is for the simple reason that the recruiting authority is the best judge of what its requirements are and it is such understanding of the recruiting authority that would matter most in cases brought up before the courts; hence, after commencement of the process wherein aspirants have participated without raising any demur as to what a particular terms means, even if any of the terms be ambiguous, the courts should lean in favour of the recruiting authority- If the procedure followed by the selecting body/appointing authority is such that the same is in breach of constitutional safeguards, an aspirant’s challenge to the procedure may not be nipped in the bud only on the ground that he has participated in the process- It may not always be possible for an aspirant to foresee any illegality in the procedure followed, till such time the select list is published. In all such cases where the illegality could not have been foreseen, a challenge to the procedure cannot be spurned on the specious ground that the aspirant having participated in the process, he has forfeited his right. (Para 19-20)

**Public Employment \- Advertisement \-** Irrespective of whether an aspirant for public employment belongs to a particular community like SC/ST/OBC, the status claimed by him for being accorded the benefit of reservation is per se not decisive. Such status has to be certified by the competent authority upon following due process and identification that the aspirant is what he claims to be. (Para 14\) \[**Context**: The issue raised was whether whether UPPRPB was bound to accept the OBC certificates submitted by candidates which, admittedly, were not in the format prescribed in the Recruitment Notification.\]

**Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 \-** Any infringement on the life and liberty of an accused should only be countenanced when the prosecution meets the standard of ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’.

**Motor Accident Compensation \-** SC accepts the contention that as an insurer, the liability is only to indemnify the loss of estate of the insured, that too, in monetary terms, by pecuniary compensation as awarded by the Tribunal \- Insurer cannot be required to ensure the future wellbeing, which in any event can be computed in monetary terms and awarded as ‘just compensation’.

**Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 \-** it cannot be said that there should necessarily be criminality insofar as the encroachment or trespass carried out. The mens rea or intention required is only of illegally taking possession of land, through unlawful or arbitrary means, by oneself or through others, for creation of third party rights, carrying out constructions or use and occupation unauthorisedly \- the allegation of any act of land grabbing is the sine qua non for maintaining an application under the Act and not the truth or otherwise of such an allegation. However, to hold that a person is a land grabber, it is necessary to find that the allegations satisfying the requirement of land grabbing are proved to make out a case that the appellant is a land grabber. The applicant should include both the ingredients, the factum as well as the intention, that the person accused of land grabbing falls under the definition clause (d) of section 2 of the Act and that the intention was to illegally take possession of such land, as required under clause (c) of Section 2\. (Para 7-8)  
**Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 \- Section 10** \- On prima facie proof being offered the onus will shift to the land grabber, since there is a presumption arising if the ownership of the subject land is proved prima facie. The allegation of land grabbing by itself does not give rise to the presumption, which arises only when prima facie the ownership is established, at which point the alleged land grabber can lead evidence to rebut the presumption. Merely because of the shifting of the onus, on the initial prima facie burden being discharged, it cannot be said that there is a prejudice caused (Para 14\)

**Child Custody \-** Meaningful contact with both parents is an integral component for the child’s welfare \-Where a non-custodial parent demonstrates consistency to be with the child, pays maintenance, and arranges his professional life around the child’s calendar, procedure ought not to stand in the way of a predictable schedule- Custody litigation at Family Court generally proceeds at a measured pace and compelling repetitive applications for what is, in essence, the same relief reduces the child’s time, exhausts the father’s limited leave, and invites avoidable conflict at every turn.

(Para 38-39)  
**Criminal Trial** \- SC noted that in this case, medical officer in his testimony, did neither elaborate number and nature of injuries nor did he give specific opinion regarding the cause of death and observed: If the Public Prosecutor was negligent in performing his duties, the presiding officer of the trial Court should have remained vigilant and the Court questions should have been put to the medical officer regarding the number and nature of injuries caused to the deceased and to seek a clear opinion regarding the cause of death.

**Criminal Investigation \- Transfer \-** The credibility of investigating agency should be impeachable. Further, the power to transfer investigations to a certain investigating agency must be sparingly used in the interest of justice and to maintain public trust on the institution. If the investigating agency is privy to the dispute, it may raise doubts on the credibility of investigation and thus, make out a ground to transfer the investigation \- Referred to Narmada Bai v. State of Gujarat (2011) 5 SCC 79\. (Para 25\) \[**Context**: SC allowed the plea to transfer investigation in a custodial death case\]

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 173(8)** \-A direction to conduct further investigation even after filing of the chargesheet and commencement of the trial is permissible in law \- Referred to Hasanbhai Valibhai Qureshi v. State of Gujarat- The prime consideration for directing further investigation is to arrive at the truth and to do real substantial justice- The further investigation and re- investigation stand altogether on a different footing. Even de hors any direction from the Court, it is open to the police to conduct a proper investigation notwithstanding the fact that the Court has already taken cognizance on the strength of a police report submitted earlier. However, before directing such investigation, the Court or the concerned police officer has to apply mind to the material available on record and arrive at a satisfaction that investigation of such allegations is necessary for the just decision of the case. \[In this case, the Court noted that the complainant had the liberty to set out her entire case/grievances in her examination-in-chief and make a prayer to the trial Court that the remaining family members who had been left out, should also be proceeded against by summoning them under Section 319 CrPC. If, at all, certain facts were left out from being narrated in the deposition of the complainant, an application under Section 311 CrPC could have been filed for recalling her and for conducting the further examination- HC order set aside\]

**Judiciary \-Court Managers** \- Professionally qualified Court Managers are necessary to render assistance to the courts in performing the court administration \- The appointment of Court Managers in the district judicial system would enable the District Judges to devote more time to their core work, that is, judicial functions- This would also help in identifying the weaknesses in the court management systems and for rectifying the same, recommend appropriate steps under the supervision of their respective judges (Para 32)- **Directions**: High Courts in the country shall frame or amend the rules providing for recruitment and conditions of service of Court Managers, by taking the Assam Rules of 2018 as the model Rules, and submit it to the State Government for approval within a period of 3 months from the date of this judgment- upon receipt of the rules framed or amendments thereof by the High Courts, the respective State Governments shall finalise and grant approval to the same within a further period of 3 months- (Para 44\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 386,401 \[Section 427,442 BNSS\] \-** No appellant by filing an appeal can be worse-off than what he was \- The appellate court, in an appeal filed by the accused cannot, while maintaining the conviction, enhance the sentence \- In an appeal filed by the accused seeking setting aside of the conviction of sentence, the High Court cannot exercise its revisional powers and while affirming the conviction, direct for enhancement of sentence where appeal could have been filed by the State, complainant or the victim and has not been filed- Where an appeal has been filed by the accused challenging the conviction and the sentence, the revisional jurisdiction cannot be exercised by the High Court so as to remand the matter to the trial court for the purpose of enhancement of the sentence. (Para 27-28) The power to enhance the sentence can be exercised by the appellate court only in an appeal filed by the State, victim or complainant provided the accused has had an opportunity of showing cause against such enhancement. (Para 31\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 377, 401 \[Section 418,442 BNSS\] \-**Even while exercising appellate powers under Section 377 CrPC, there cannot be exclusion of revisional jurisdiction of the High Court to act suo motu for enhancement of sentence in appropriate cases and what is an appropriate case has to be left to the discretion of the High Court. Further, the High Court can suo motu call for the record of proceedings of any inferior criminal court under its jurisdiction and exercise revisional powers. (Para 29\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \-** The distinction between 'appellate jurisdiction' and 'revisional jurisdiction’ discussed \- In law, ‘revision’ stands on a different footing from an ‘appeal’. In a revision, the revising authority is not bound to examine the facts for itself but is entitled to give its decision on points of law alone, whereas in an appeal, the whole case is before the appellate authority, which must enter into questions both of fact and law. Also in a revision, the person seeking revision has mere restricted rights than one who prefers an appeal. Whereas an appeal confers statutory vested right on the litigant which accrues the moment the proceedings in question are instituted, the right of revision is merely a discretionary power to be exercised by the revisional court according to the circumstances of the case or exigencies of the situation. A person cannot as a matter of right claim the proceedings to be revised. (Para 28.6)

**Legal Maxims- Reformatio in peius \-** It is a latin phrase meaning a change towards the worse i.e., a change for the worse. As a legal expression it means that a lower court judgment is amended by a higher court into a worse one for those appealing it. In many jurisdictions, this practice is forbidden ensuring that an appellant cannot be placed in a worse position as a result of filing an appeal. When the above phrase is prefixed by the words ‘no’ or ‘prohibition’, which would render the maxim as no reformatio in peius or prohibition of reformatio in peius, it would denote a principle of procedure as per which using a remedy available in law should not aggravate the situation of the person who avails the remedy. In other words, a person should not be placed in a worse position as a result of filing an appeal. No reformatio in peius or prohibition of reformatio in peius is a part of fair procedure and thus by extension can also be construed as part of natural justice. It is not only a procedural guarantee but is also a principle of equity. (Para 32\)

**Environment Impact Assessment Notification**  \- The concept of ex post facto or retrospective EC is completely alien to environmental jurisprudence and the EIA notification (Para 18)- The 2017 notification and the 2021 OM as well as all circulars/orders/OMs/notifications issued for giving effect to these notifications are illegal and are hereby struck down \-Central Government restrained from issuing circulars/orders/OMs/notifications providing for grant of ex post facto EC in any form or manner or for regularising the acts done in contravention of the EIA notification- ECs already granted till date under the 2017 notification and the 2021 OM shall, however, remain unaffected.

**Ex post facto**\- Various dictionary meanings can be summarised as under: a) Having retrospective effect or force; b) From a thing done afterwards; c) Retroactive or affecting something that has already happened. (Para 28\)

**Quotable Quotes** \- In environmental matters, the Courts must take a very strict view of the violations of the laws relating to the environment. It is the duty of the Constitutional Courts to do so. (Para 32\) Can there be development at the cost of environment? Conservation of environment and its improvement is an essential part of the concept of development. (Para 34\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 438 \[Section 482 BNSS\] \- Anticipatory Bail \- Custodial interrogation** \-Even in cases where custodial interrogation may not be required the court is obliged to consider the entire case put up by the State, more particularly, the nature of the offence, the punishment provided in law for such offence etc. \- For the purpose of custodial interrogation, the investigating agency has to make out a prima facie case at the time when remand is prayed for. Whether any case for police remand is made out or not, it is for the Court concerned to look into. (Para 23-24) \- 

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 438 \[Section 482 BNSS\] \- Anticipatory Bail** \-**Political vendetta** by itself is not sufficient for the grant of anticipatory bail. The courts should not just look into the aspect of political vendetta and ignore the other materials on record constituting a prima facie case as alleged by the State. It is only when the court is convinced more than prima facie that the allegations are frivolous and baseless, that the court may bring into the element of political vendetta into consideration for the purpose of considering the plea of anticipatory bail. The frivolity in the entire case that the court may look into should be attributed to political bias or vendetta. (Para 27\)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 438 \[Section 482 BNSS\] \- Anticipatory Bail \- In corruption cases** concerning influential persons, effective interrogation of the suspect is of tremendous advantage in disinterring many useful information and also materials which are likely to be concealed. Success in such interrogation would elude if the suspected person knows that he is well protected and insulated by a pre-arrest bail order during the time he is interrogated. Very often interrogation in such condition would reduce to a mere ritual.(Para 19\)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 24-30 \[Section 22-24 BSA\] :** A Confessional statement of an accused will only be admissible if it is not hit by Section(s) 24 or 25 respectively and is in tune with the provisions of Section(s) 26, 28 and 29 of the Evidence Act respectively \-A police statement of an accused which is in the form of a confession is per se inadmissible and no reliance whatsoever can be placed on such statements either at the stage of bail or during trial. Since such confessional statements are rendered inadmissible by virtue of Section 25 of the Evidence Act, the provision of Section 30 would be of no avail, and no reliance can be placed on such confessional statement of an accused to implicate another co-accused. (Para 53- iv)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 438, 161 \[Section 482,180 BNSS\]**Before the court looks into the police statement of any person under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C for the purpose of anticipatory or regular bail, the court must first ascertain whether such person is actually a witness or an accused person, or likely to be an accused person in respect of the offence(s) alleged \-There may be situations where a person while giving his statement under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C may not be an accused, but later arrayed as one. In such a scenario the courts must be mindful of the fact that because the investigation is still ongoing, a person who was originally a witness may happen to be later arrayed as an accused person. If the court was to blindly place reliance on statement of such a person merely because he is not named in the first information report, without first seeing whether such person is likely to be arrayed as an accused or not, it would lead to an absurd situation where the statement of such a person may be relied upon up until such person is arrayed as an accused \- Where it emerges from the material on record, that such a person is likely to be arrayed as an accused, the courts should refrain from expressing any such opinion so that the investigation is not prejudiced in any manner. (Para 53-x)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 24-30 \[Section 22-24 BSA\] :**A confessional statement of one accused implicating another co- accused may be taken into consideration by the court against such co- accused in terms of Section 30 of the Evidence Act, only at the stage of trial, where (1) the confession itself was relevant and admissible in terms of the Evidence Act; (2) was duly proved against the maker; (3) such confessional statement incriminates the maker along with the co- accused and; (4) both the accused persons in question are in a joint trial for the same offence- Such a confession can only be pressed into consideration by the court as a rule of prudence, to lend assurance to the other evidence against such co-accused- Such confession cannot be taken into consideration under Section 30 where the confession itself was not relevant or inadmissible or where a co-accused was not being tried jointly with the accused person who made the confession or where he did not make a statement incriminating himself along with the co- accused(Para 37, 53- v, vi) 

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 17,21, 30 \[Section 15,19,24 BSA\]** Where the police statement of an accused is in the form of an admission, such inculpatory statement even if it implicates another co-accused cannot be taken into consideration against such co-accused in terms of Section(s) 17 read with 21 of the Evidence Act, as doing so would militate against the general principle, that an admission may be given as evidence against the maker alone. The exceptions to the aforesaid general principle carved out under the Evidence Act, do not permit the usage of such admission against a co-accused in any scenario whatsoever. (Para 53- vii)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 161-162 \-\[Section 180,181 BNSS\]** A person who is accused of an offence or named in the first information report, can be examined by the police and his statement may be recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C \- A statement of an accused under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C, would ordinarily be of two kinds, it may be inculpatory in nature or may be exculpatory in nature \- An inculpatory statement again may be in the form of an admission or a confession. If such statement admits either a gravely incriminating fact or substantially all the facts which constitute the offence, respectively, then it amounts to confession. (Para 53-i-iii) 

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 161-162 \-\[Section 180,181 BNSS\] \-** Where the police statement of the accused is an exculpatory statement i.e., it is neither a confession nor an admission, the statement being one under Section 161, would immediately attract the bar under Section 162 of the Cr.PC., and the same may be used only for the very limited purpose provided in the Proviso for the purpose of contradiction or re- examination of such accused person alone \-Even if such exculpatory statement of one accused, implicates another co-accused, the same cannot be taken into consideration against such co-accused, as there can be no credibility attached to an exculpatory statement of an accused implicating another co-accused, more particularly because it is neither required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the co-accused, the same cannot be tested by cross- examination and the exculpatory nature of such statement militates against the foundational principle that permits taking into consideration a statement of one accused person against another co-accused. (Para 53- viii) Where such statement of the accused is exculpatory in nature, the same can be looked into by the courts only for the limited purpose of either culling out the stance of the accused person qua the allegations or for contradicting the accused, if the accused chooses to be examined as a witness in terms of Section 315 of the Cr.P.C.. However, such exculpatory statement insofar as it implicates another accused person cannot be looked into by the courts, as such statements by their nature cannot be tested by cross-examination if such accused person declines to be a witness in the trial in terms of Section 315 of the Cr.P.C., and because such exculpatory statement has no credibility. (Para 53-x)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 161-162 \-\[Section 180,181 BNSS\]** \- While it is permissible for the courts to examine the statements recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. for the purpose of ascertaining whether a prima-facie case has been made out against the accused and the nature or gravity of the allegations, the same applies only insofar as such police statements are of witnesses and not accused persons. (Para 45\)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 30 \[Section 24 BSA\]** Section 30 of Evidence Act postulates that such a confession can be taken into consideration only where the accused persons are jointly tried. The said provision does not merely require that the persons must be accused of the same offence, but rather requires that they must be being tried jointly for the said offence \- Joint trial here refers to the one provided under Section 223 CrPC- Thus, where the accused persons are either not being tried jointly, or are yet to be charged for the same offence and thereafter tried together, Section 30 of the Evidence Act would be inapplicable- Section 30 of the Evidence Act, would not spring into action when the charges are yet to be framed and the accused persons are yet to be committed to trial, and any confession admissible thereunder cannot be taken into consideration by the courts.

**Criminal Investigation \- Multiple FIRs \-** Writ Petition seeking direction for clubbing and transferring the multiple First Information Reports (FIRs) registered against the petitioner in different States to the Court of competent jurisdiction at Panchkula, Haryana- SC observed: Multiplicity of proceedings will not be in larger public interest. Further, since many States have invoked local Acts, particularly the Act dealing with the Protection of Interest of Depositors, transferring them out of the State also will not serve the ends of justice. Hence, the correct course of action would be to merge the FIRs with the earliest FIR in the State concerned. It is clarified that if the first FIR in the respective States of Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand is registered in respect of offence under the general law and not the special enactment, but if the subsequent FIRs now clubbed are registered in connection with the special law or registered also in connection with the special law, the same after clubbing must be tried under the special law by the Special Court(s).

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \[Section 528 BNSS \] \-** High Courts can exercise power under Section 482 of CrPC (Section 528 of the BNSS) for quashing the proceedings emanating from the application under Section 12(1) of the DV Act, 2005, pending before the Court of the learned Magistrate. However, considering the object of the DV Act, 2005, the High Courts should exercise caution and circumspection when dealing with an application under Section 12(1). Normally, interference under Section 482 is warranted only in the case of gross illegality or injustice. (Para 39\) \[SC has clarified that it is not dealing with other legal proceedings in which reliefs under Sections 18 to 22 are sought in the Courts referred to in Section 26 of the DV Act. (Para 25)\]  
**Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 \-** Notwithstanding the penal provisions in the form of Sections 31 and 33 of Chapter V, the proceedings before the Magistrate under the DV Act, 2005, are predominantly of a civil nature. (Para 28.1)  
**Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 \-Section 12 \- Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 200 \[Section 223 BNSS \]** \- An application under Section 12 of the DV Act, 2005, cannot be equated with a complaint within the meaning of Section 200 of the CrPC (Section 223 of the BNSS)- the normal rule is that a notice of hearing must be issued on the application. The scheme of Section 12 is completely different from Section 200 of the CrPC or Section 223 of the BNSS. (Para 21\)  
**Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 \-Section 12,26,27 \-** The Court of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class or the Metropolitan Magistrate, as the case may be, has jurisdiction to entertain applications under Section 12 of the DV Act, 2005 as can be seen from the provisions of Sections 12 and 27 read with clause (i) of Section 2 of the DV Act, 2005- in a given case, in any legal proceedings pending before a Civil Court or Family Court affecting the aggrieved person, the reliefs under Sections 18 to 22 can be sought. Similarly, in a Criminal Court other than the Courts of Judicial Magistrate of the First Class and Metropolitan Magistrate, reliefs under Sections 18 to 22 can be sought. For example, in proceedings before a Court of Session, such reliefs can be sought provided the proceeding affects the aggrieved person. We must note here that Section 26 does not confer jurisdiction on Courts other than the Courts mentioned in Section 27 to entertain an application under Section 12 of the DV Act, 2005\. It only enables the Courts mentioned therein to grant the reliefs under Sections 18 to 22 in the pending legal proceedings. (Para 24.1)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \[Section 528 BNSS \] \-** **Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 \-Section 12,26,27 \-**When it comes to exercise of power under Section 482 of the CrPC in relation to application under Section 12(1), the High Court has to keep in mind the fact that the DV Act, 2005 is a welfare legislation specially enacted to give justice to those women who suffer from domestic violence and for preventing acts of domestic violence. Therefore, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC for quashing proceedings under Section 12(1), the High Court should be very slow and circumspect. Interference can be made only when the case is clearly of gross illegality or gross abuse of the process of law. Generally, the High Court must adopt a hands-off approach while dealing with proceedings under Section 482 for quashing an application under Section 12(1). Unless the High Courts show restraint in the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC while dealing with a prayer for quashing the proceedings under the DV Act, 2005, the very object of enacting the DV Act, 2005, will be defeated.

**Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 \- Section 7A** \- When a claim of juvenility was raised or if the court was of the opinion that a person was a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence, the court was mandated to make an inquiry and after taking such evidence as might be necessary, was mandatorily required to record a finding whether the person was a juvenile or a child or not, stating his age as nearly as possible. As per the proviso, a claim of juvenility could be raised before any court and at any stage. If upon such inquiry, court found the person to be a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence, it had to forward the juvenile to the Juvenile Justice Board for passing appropriate orders and the sentence if any, passed by a court, would be deemed to have no effect. Where a juvenile charged with an offence was produced before a Juvenile Justice Board then in terms of Section 14(1) of the JJ Act, the Juvenile Justice Board was required to hold an inquiry in accordance with the provisions of the JJ Act and make such order in relation to the juvenile as it deemed fit. If the Juvenile Justice Board found that the juvenile had committed an offence then Section 15 of the JJ Act kicked in. Under Section 15 of the JJ Act, the Juvenile Justice Board could take various steps as contemplated thereunder and under sub-section (1)(g) had the discretion to make an order directing the juvenile to be sent to a special home for a period of 3 years, which period could be reduced in an appropriate case in terms of the proviso.

(Para 23\) **Delay** \- Mere delay during the inquiry proceedings, when it is explained with regard to the time taken for the inquiry to conclude and that too justifying the same with no prejudice having been caused, cannot be made the basis for vitiating the departmental proceedings. Inordinate or unexplained delay in the departmental proceedings may be a justifiable ground if tampered with prejudice having been established to have been caused to the delinquent employee in the said process for interference by the Court (Para 26)- **Natural Justice-** The principles of natural justice are founded on three fundamental rules that ensure fairness in legal and administrative proceedings. Firstly, the Hearing Rule (Audi Alteram Partem) which mandates that no person should be judged without being given a fair opportunity to present his case. Secondly, the Bias Rule (Nemo Judex in Causa Sua) which asserts that no one should act as a judge in its own case, thereby safeguarding impartiality and preventing any form of bias. Lastly, the principle of Reasoned Decision, also known as Speaking Orders, requires every decision to be supported by valid and clearly stated reasons to promote transparency and accountability in the decision-making process.

**Income Tax Act 1961 \- Section 80-IA** \- If a deduction of profits and gains under Section 80-IA is claimed and allowed, the deduction to the extent of such profits and gains in any other provision under the heading ‘C’ is not allowed. The deduction to the extent allowed under Section 80-IA cannot be allowed under any other provision under heading ‘C’. Therefore, if deduction to the extent of ‘X’ is claimed and allowed out of gross total income of ‘Y’ under Section 80-IA and the assessee wants to claim deduction under any other provision under the heading ‘C’, though he may be entitled to deduction ‘Y’ under the said provision, he will get deduction under the other provisions to the extent of (Y-X) and in no case total deductions under heading ‘C’ can exceed the profits and gains of such eligible business of undertaking or enterprise- Sub-section (9) of Section 80-IA, on its plain reading, does not provide that when a deduction is allowed under Section 80-IA, while considering the claim for deduction under any of the provision under heading ‘C’, the deduction allowed under Section 80-IA should be deducted from the gross total income. The restriction under sub-section (9) of Section 80-IA is not on computing the total gross income. It restricts deduction under any other provision under heading ‘C’ to the extent of the deduction claimed under Section 80- IA. (Para 20-21)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \-Section 228 \[Section 251 BNSS\] \- Scope of hearing at the time of framing of the charge** \- Firstly, at this stage, the Court can examine only the documents forming part of the charge sheet, and no other material can be considered. Secondly, after considering the material on record, the Court has to decide whether or not there exists a sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial against the appellant. Thirdly, at this stage, the Court cannot sift the evidence forming a part of the chargesheet with a view to separating the grain from the chaff. Fourthly, if the Court is of the view that the evidence without cross-examination or rebuttal shows that the accused has not committed any offence, then an order of discharge must be passed. Lastly, if the evidence adduced before the Court creates a grave suspicion against the accused, the Court will not discharge the accused. (Para 9\)

### 

**Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 \- Section 44(2) \- Witness Protection** \-An omnibus application cannot be made by the Special Public Prosecutor for the grant of protection under Section 44 for all witnesses or a number of witnesses. Even if an application is made in respect of more than one witness, specific averments in relation to every witness must be made in the application. In our view, sub-section 2 of Section 44 of the UAPA (sub-section 2 of Section 17 of NIA) must be strictly complied with, as the exercise of the power may affect the right of the accused to defend. (Para 11\) Section 44 (2) can be invoked by a prosecution witness or by the Public Prosecutor. In a given case, even the Special Court can exercise this power suo motu (Para 9\) The first condition precedent for the exercise of powers under Section 44(2) is the recording of the satisfaction by the Special Court that the life of the concerned witness is in danger. Obviously, this satisfaction must be recorded based on the material available before the Special Court. The extent and the nature of the material required to record such satisfaction will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Since Section 44 (2) UAPA is an exception to the general rule, the condition precedent for the exercise of power of recording a clear satisfaction based on material as stated above must be complied with. After recording the satisfaction, the second stage comes into play. It is not that in every case that after such satisfaction is recorded, the Court can pass an order prohibiting the prosecution from providing a copy of the entire statement of the prosecution witnesses till the conclusion of the trial. The Court has to apply its mind considering the material on record, what kind of measures should be adopted for keeping the identity and address of such a witness, secret. While deciding what kind of measures should be adopted, the Court must record brief reasons. (Para 9\) The satisfaction as required by sub-section 2 of Section 44 of UAPA has to be recorded qua an individual witness.(Para 15\)  The accused has a right of hearing on the application under sub-section 2 of Section 44 of the UAPA, but obviously, till orders are passed by the Court on the application and subject to such orders, the accused is not entitled to know the identity of the witnesses in respect of whom the application is made. If, during the pendency of the application, the identity of the witness is disclosed in any manner, the very purpose of the power conferred on Section 44(2) of the UAPA will be lost. (Para 21\)

**NEET \- Seat Blocking** \- Seat Blocking in NEET-PG counselling occurs when candidates temporarily accept seats, only to abandon them later after securing more preferred options. This leads to those seats remaining unavailable in earlier rounds and opening up only in later stages, disadvantaging higher-ranked aspirants, who may have already committed to less preferred choices. Delays in state counselling, last-minute seat additions or deletions, and lack of coordination between quotas worsen the issue. As a result, lower-ranked candidates can secure better seats by taking risks, while merit-based selection is undermined. (Para 8\) \- This malpractice distorts the actual availability of seats, fosters inequity among aspirants, and often reduces the process to one governed more by chance than merit. Seat blocking is not merely an isolated wrongdoing – it reflects deeper systemic flaws rooted in fragmented governance, lack of transparency, and weak policy enforcement. (Para 7\) Directions issued: (i) Implement a Nationally synchronized counselling calendar to align AIQ and State rounds and prevent seat blocking across systems. (ii) Mandate Pre-Counselling Fee Disclosure by all private / deemed universities, detailing tuition, hostel, caution deposit, and miscellaneous charges. (iii) Establish a Centralized Fee Regulation Framework under the National Medical Commission (NMC) (iv) Permit upgrade windows post-round 2 for admitted candidates to shift to better seats without reopening counselling to new entrants. (v) Publish raw scores, answer keys and normalization formulae for transparency in multi-shift NEET-PG exams. (vi) Enforce strict penalties for seat blocking including forfeiture of security deposit, disqualification from future NEET-PG exams (for repeat offenders), blacklisting of complicit colleges. (vii) Implement Aadhaar-based seat tracking to prevent multiple seat holdings and misrepresentation. (viii) Hold state authorities and institutional DMEs accountable under contempt or disciplinary action for rule or schedule violations. (ix) Adopt a Uniform Counselling Conduct Code across all States for standard rules on eligibility, mop-up rounds, seat withdrawal, and grievance timelines. (x) Set up a third-party oversight mechanism under NMC for annual audits of counselling data, compliance, and admission fairness.

**Forest Service \-** Insofar as writing of ACRs up to the rank of APCCF is concerned, the “reporting authority” should be the immediate superior authority in the Forest Department. The position is clear as regards “reviewing authority” or “reporting authority” in relation to officers up to the rank of APCCF. It is clear that except the PCCF, the “reporting authority” has to be a superior officer from the IFS. It is only with regard to PCCF that the “reporting authority” would be a person to whom he reports and who is superior to him in rank. No doubt that, if necessary, the State Governments can provide that the Collectors and Commissioners can record their comments on a separate sheet about the performance of the IFS officers in relation to the implementation of developmental work funded by the district administration. However, the same is again required to be considered by a superior departmental officer of the IFS. (Para 37\)

**Criminal Trial \- Circumstantial Evidence** \- In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution is obliged to prove each circumstance, taken cumulatively to form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probabilities, crime was committed by the accused and none else. Further, the facts so proved should unerringly point towards the guilt of the accused.

**Interpretation of Statutes**\- The retrospectivity of a statute is to be tested on the anvil of the doctrine of “fairness”. The substratum of a beneficial legislation is to ensure that the benefit is uniform and absolute, which may be prospective in nature, but when such benefit to one person does not inflict any undue burden on the other, the purposive construction can be considered to be given a retrospective effect- Except in cases where such enactments or issuance of Circulars are arbitrary, vexatious or constitute a parallel mechanism making its operation unfair, the Courts need not entertain objections to the operation of a clarificatory/declaratory provision which is only intended to assert & give effect to its parent provision/statute. (Para 18\) \[**Context**: SC held that Appellant is entitled to the benefit of 1 % AIR Customs Duty Drawback on its export of SBM from the year 2008 as applicable, by according retrospective operation to the Circular No. 35/2010- Cus. dated 17.09.2010 issued by the Central Board of Excise & Customs, New Delhi, for the purposes of All Industry Rate (AIR) Duty Drawbacks.\]

**Judiciary \-** A greater representation of women in the judiciary, would greatly improve the overall quality of judicial decision making and this impacts generally and also specifically in cases affecting women. (Para 29\) Advancing women’s greater participation in the judiciary also plays a role in promoting gender equality in broader ways: a. Female judicial appointments, particularly at senior levels, can shift gender stereotypes, thereby changing attitudes and perceptions as to appropriate roles of men and women. b. Women’s visibility as judicial officers can pave the way for women’s greater representation in other decision-making positions, such as in legislative and executive branches of government. c. Higher numbers, and greater visibility, of women judges can increase the willingness of women to seek justice and enforce their rights through the courts \- The country will greatly benefit from a judicial force that is competent, committed and most importantly, diverse. (Para 30\)

**Probationer \-** Even though a probationer has no right to hold a post, it would not imply that the mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution could be violated inasmuch as there cannot be any arbitrary or discriminatory discharge or an absence of application of mind in the matter of assessment of performance and consideration of relevant materials. Thus, in deciding whether, in a given case, a termination was by way of punishment or not, the courts have to look into the substance of the matter and not the form. (Para 26 ) The services of a probationer could result either in a confirmation in the post or ended by way of termination simpliciter. However, if a probationer is terminated from service owing to a misconduct as a punishment, the termination would cause a stigma on him. If a probationer is unsuitable for a job and has been terminated then such a case is non-stigmatic as it is a termination simpliciter. Thus, the performance of a probationer has to be considered in order to ascertain whether it has been satisfactory or unsatisfactory. If the performance of a probationer has been unsatisfactory, he is liable to be terminated by the employer without conducting any inquiry. No right of hearing is also reserved with the probationer and hence, there would be no violation of principles of natural justice in such a case. if a termination from service is not visited with any stigma and neither are there any civil consequences and nor is founded on misconduct, then, it would be a case of termination simpliciter. On the other hand, an assessment of remarks pertaining to the discharge of duties during the probationary period even without a finding of misconduct and termination on the basis of such remarks or assessment will be by way of punishment because such remarks or assessment would be stigmatic. According to the dictionary meaning, stigma is indicative of a blemish, disgrace indicating a deviation from a norm. Stigma might be inferred from the references quoted in the termination order although the order itself might not contain anything offensive. Where there is a discharge from service after prescribed probation period was completed and the discharge order contain allegations against a probationer and surrounding circumstances also showed that discharge was not based solely on the assessment of the employee’s work and conduct during probation, the termination was held to be stigmatic and punitive.

**Constitution of India \- Seventh Schedule** \- Broadcasting is a form of communication and entertainment is a species of luxuries under Entry 62 – List II- State Legislature  fully justified in imposing entertainment tax under Entry 62 – List II- The said entry contemplates imposition of taxes, inter alia, on the entire genus of “entertainments and amusements”- The pith and substance of the provisions of the State Act referred to above are in the realm of taxation of providers/receivers of entertainment/amusement as luxuries within the said Entry through the medium of television which involves broadcasting service which is regulated under Entry 31 – List I as a form of communication in accordance with Prasar Bharti Act, 1990\. (Para 8\)

**Constitution of India \- Seventh Schedule** \- Entry 31 – List I deals with various forms of communications including broadcasting. The said Entry does not deal with entertainments or amusements as luxuries. Entry 97 – List I deals with any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those lists. Entry 31 \- List I is a regulatory entry while Entry 97 \- List I, inter alia, can be the basis for imposition of any tax such as service tax as per the provisions of the Finance Act, 1994 and its subsequent amendments. (Para 17.5)

**Doctrine of pith and substance-**   If an enactment substantially falls within the powers expressly conferred by the Constitution upon the legislature which enacted it, the same cannot be held to be invalid merely because it incidentally encroaches on matters assigned to another legislature. Also, in a situation where there is overlapping, the said doctrine has to be applied to determine to which entry, a piece of legislation could be related to by examining the true character of the enactment or a provision thereof. Due regard must be had to the enactment as a whole and to its scope and objects. It is said that the question of invasion into another legislative territory has to be determined by substance and not by degree. According to the pith and substance doctrine, if a law is in its pith and substance within the competence of the Legislature which has made it, it will not be invalid because it incidentally touches upon the subject lying within the competence of another Legislature. (Para 8.22)

**Constitution of India \- Seventh Schedule \-** Taxation is considered to be a distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence and the power to tax cannot be deduced from the general legislative entry as an ancillary power. Also, a power to legislate as to the principal matter specifically mentioned in the entry shall also include within its expanse legislation touching only upon incidental and ancillary matters. But the power to levy tax cannot be considered to be an incidental and ancillary matter while interpreting an entry in the Lists concerning legislative competence of Parliament or legislature of any State to enact laws on the subjects mentioned in the entry. (8.2.17) while interpreting a taxation entry in List I or List II, all efforts must be made to interpret them in such a way as to give content and meaning to the same having regard to the constitutional scheme under which the distribution of legislative powers have been envisaged in the Seventh Schedule and bearing in mind and the object and intent behind them. (Para 17.12)

**Taxation** \- A legislative enactment which provides for the imposition of a tax must specify the following parameters of taxation: (i) The taxable event which forms the basis of levy, also referred to as “subject” of a tax; (ii) The measure of the tax; (iii) The rate(s) of taxation; and (iv) The incidence of the tax.   The said parameters are each distinct and must not be conflated with the others. (Para 8.26-27) **Principles of interpretation of taxation entries**\- i. In interpreting expressions in the Legislative Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, a wide meaning should be given to the entries. ii. In the scheme of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule, there exists a clear distinction between the general subjects of legislation and heads of taxation. They are separately enumerated. iii. As the fields of taxation are to be found clearly enumerated in Lists I and II, there can be no overlapping in law. There may be overlapping in fact, but there can be no overlapping in law. iv. In the first instance, the pith and substance or true nature and character of the legislation must be determined with reference to the legislative subject matter and the charging section; v. The measure of tax is not a true test of the nature of tax; vi. The same transaction may involve two or more taxable events in its different aspects. Merely because the aspects overlap, such overlapping does not detract from the distinctiveness of the aspects. (Para 11.18)

**Aspect Theory \-** The ‘Aspect’ theory, also known as the ‘double aspect doctrine’- the aspect doctrine is applied to ascertain whether a legislature can tax on a particular aspect of a transaction/activity rather than on competence of a legislature vis-à-vis the scope of entries in List I or List II- The aspect theory, in the Indian context, comes into play at the level of determining the applicability of a taxing statute on the activity sought to be taxed. Invariably, an activity conducted by an assessee which is sought to be taxed by a legislation, may have different aspects. The aspect theory is used to determine if, in fact, there are different aspects within the activity sought to be taxed and whether, the taxable event which forms the basis of the levy in a legislative enactment corresponds to any aspect in the activity sought to be taxed.

**Res Judicata \-** The principles of res judicata apply not only to two different proceedings but also to different stages of the same proceeding as well. \- Referred to Bhanu Kumar Jain v. Archana Kumar reported in (2005) 1 SCC 787

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order I Rule 10 \-** Order I Rule 10 inter alia empowers the court to allow addition, substitution or deletion of a party to a suit at any stage of the proceedings \- The power to strike out or add parties under Sub-rule (2) can be exercised by the court on an application made by the parties before it, or upon an application by a third party who desires to be added as a party, or even suo motu. (Para 45\) 

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Order I Rule 10 and Order XXII Rule 4 \-** The power to strike out or add a party to the proceedings under Order I Rule 10 can be exercised by the court at any stage of the proceeding. However, the same cannot be construed to mean that when a particular party has been impleaded as a legal heir under Order XXII Rule 4 after due inquiry by the court and without any objections, the party can approach the court anytime later and seek his deletion from the array of parties by filing an application under Order I Rule 10\. If at all the appellant was aggrieved by his impleadment as a legal heir, the suitable course of action was to first object to his impleadment under Sub-rule (2) of Order XXII Rule 4\. (Para 51\)

**Specific Relief Act 1963** \- When the exclusive possession of the suit property could be said to be with the original defendant when the suit was decreed, the relief of transfer of possession is implicit in the decree for specific performance directing the original defendant to execute a sale deed in the favour of the original plaintiff \- Referred to [Rohit Kochhar v.

**SARFAESI Act \- Section 11** \-Section 11 of the SARFAESI Act, provides for a statutory arbitration for any dispute mentioned therein between any of the parties enumerated thereunder. There is no need for an explicit written agreement to arbitrate between such parties in order to attract Section 11 of the SARFAESI Act. The said provision creates a legal fiction as regards the existence of an arbitration agreement notwithstanding whether such agreement exists or not in actuality. (Para 124-I,V) Section 11 of the SARFAESI Act is mandatory in nature. The use of the word “shall” therein, the mandate of the said provision cannot be bypassed or subverted by the parties by seeking recourse elsewhere. (Para 124-VI) There is no need for an explicit written agreement to arbitrate between such parties in order to attract Section 11 of the SARFAESI Act. The said provision creates a legal fiction as regards the existence of an arbitration agreement notwithstanding whether such agreement exists or not in actuality. (Para 124-V) In order to attract the provision of Section 11 of the SARFAESI Act, twin conditions have to be fulfilled being; first, the dispute must be between any bank or financial institution or asset reconstruction company or qualified buyer and secondly, the dispute must relate to securitisation or reconstruction or non-payment of any amount due including interest. Where the aforesaid two conditions are found to be prima-facie satisfied, there the DRT will have no jurisdiction and the proper recourse would only be through Section 11 of the SARFAESI Act read with the Act, 1996- The expression “non-payment of any amount due, including interest” used in Section 11 of the SARFAESI Act is of wide import and would include a various range of scenarios of ‘disputes’ connected to unpaid amounts including those arising due to third-party defaults, such as indirect defaults of the borrowers- Any dispute between two banks, financial institutions, asset reconstruction companies or qualified buyers etc., where the jural relation between the two is of a lender and borrower, then Section 11 of the SARFAESI Act will have no application whatsoever. The use of the phrase “any person” in the definition of ‘borrower’ in Section 2(f) of the SARFAESI Act, makes it abundantly clear that even a bank, financial institution or asset reconstruction company or qualified buyer can be considered a borrower, if they receive financial assistance from a bank or financial institution etc by providing or creating a security interest. Thus, a lender-turned-borrower would also fall within the scope of a “borrower” under the SARFAESI Act and shall be governed by the same statutory framework as any ordinary borrower. (Para 124 \-IV)

**Constitution of India \- Article 32,226 \- Cabinet Decisions-** When the State has taken a policy decision or through its Cabinet has arrived at a certain conclusion, in their wisdom, after exhaustively considering all the relevant factors and recommendations, it would not be appropriate for courts to interfere or supplant the finding arrived at by the government. In the absence of any patent arbitrariness, capriciousness, mala fides or illegality, courts have always subscribed to the rule that executive decision-making must not be dissected and prodded unnecessarily. (Para 56\) When an executive Cabinet decision is the outcome of sound reasoning, an inclusive consideration of all the relevant factors and based on recommendations, it cannot be sought to be faulted with, especially through judicial intervention. Assailing it in the absence of arbitrariness and merely because a ‘better’ alternate view could have been taken or was possible, would not suffice in order to strike down such a decision or render it inoperative.

**Uttar Pradesh Gangsters & Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 \-** The satisfaction of the approving authority is sine qua non for taking action under the Act of 1986\. It is indispensable for the approving authority to record his satisfaction in his own words, to indicate application of mind before approving the gang-chart. The recording of satisfaction need not be exhaustive, because at the stage of approval the investigation under the Act of 1986 is yet to be conducted, but it must be independent, indicating the reasons justifying the exercise of jurisdiction under the Act of 1986- the satisfaction must not be a cyclostyle reproduction of the application of mind communicated by the recommending authority. This is only possible when the approving authority meticulously refers to the materials on record on the basis of which he will come to the conclusion about existence of grounds justifying registration of an FIR under the Act of 1986 \- Reiteration of the contents of the FIR or chargesheet does not constitute application of mind- Such satisfaction must stand on certain grounds; it cannot arise in absence of any basis, leaving the liberty of the accused in a precarious position. The basis of satisfaction must bear a reasonable nexus with the facts present before the concerned authority. Thus, the decision of the recommending, forwarding, and approving authorities respectively must be at the behest of the application of mind to the relevant and material facts available on record- An independent application of mind cannot be presumed unless it is demonstrable from the record that the approving authority has, in letter and spirit, independently considered all the materials that culminated in the preparation and placement of the gang chart before him. While the correctness of such application of mind may lie beyond the scope of judicial scrutiny, the absence thereof certainly does not. A mechanical or routine exercise of power by the recommending, forwarding, and approving authorities respectively is impermissible, as it directly impinges upon the liberty of citizens. (Para 51-54)  
**Uttar Pradesh Gangsters & Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 \-Section 2(b)-** The definition of the term “gang” is not attracted by mere association with a miscreant group- A group of persons may be said to constitute a gang only when they, either singly or collectively, indulge in any of the anti-social activity enumerated in clauses (i) to (xvv) of Section 2(b), by means specified therein, or otherwise, and most importantly, with the object of disturbing public order, or securing any undue temporal, pecuniary, material or other advantage for himself or any other person.

**Constitution of India \- Article 22(1) \-** For the purposes of Clause (1) of Article 22, it is not necessary for the authorities to furnish full details of the offence. However, the information should be sufficient to enable the arrested person to understand why he has been arrested. The grounds to be communicated to the arrested person should be somewhat similar to the charge framed by the Court for the trial of a case (Para 28\) \- If a person is arrested on a warrant, the grounds for reasons for the arrest is the warrant itself; if the warrant is read over to him, that is sufficient compliance with the requirement that he should be informed of the grounds for his arrest. If he is arrested without a warrant, he must be told why he has been arrested. If he is arrested for committing an offence, he must be told that he has committed a certain offence for which he would be placed on trial. In order to inform him that he has committed a certain offence, he must be told of the acts done by him which amounts to the offence. He must be informed of the precise acts done by him for which he would be tried; informing him merely of the law applicable to such acts would not be enough. (Para 36\)

State of Haryana](https://www.caseciter.com/vihaan-kumar-vs-state-of-haryana-2025-insc-162-art-22-constitution-requirement-of-informing-grounds-of-arrest-2/): a) The requirement of informing the person arrested of the grounds of arrest is not a formality but a mandatory constitutional condition. b) Once a person is arrested, his right to liberty under Article 21 is curtailed. When such an important fundamental right is curtailed, it is necessary that the person concerned must understand on what grounds he has been arrested. c) The mode of conveying the information of the grounds of arrest must be meaningful so as to serve the true object underlying Article 22(1). d) If the grounds of arrest are not informed as soon as may be after the arrest, it would amount to a violation of the fundamental right of the arrestee guaranteed under Article 22(1). e) On the failure to comply with the requirement of informing the grounds of arrest as soon as may be after the arrest, the arrest would stand vitiated. Once the arrest is held to be vitiated, the person arrested cannot remain in custody even for a second. f) If the police want to prove communication of the grounds of arrest only based on a diary entry, it is necessary to incorporate those grounds of arrest in the diary entry or any other document. The grounds of arrest must exist before the same are informed. g) When an arrestee pleads before a court that the grounds of arrest were not communicated, the burden to prove the compliance of Article 22(1) is on the police authorities. h) The grounds of arrest should not only be provided to the arrestee but also to his family members and relatives so that necessary arrangements are made to secure the release of the person arrested at the earliest possible opportunity so as to make the mandate of Article 22(1) meaningful and effective, failing which, such arrest may be rendered illegal.

**Pension \- Cut off date fixation** \- Financial constraints can constitute a valid and non-arbitrary basis for fixing a cut-off date for extending pensionary benefits or pay revisions. It emphasized that economic considerations are germane to governmental policy decisions, and distinguishing between retirees based on such a date does not violate Article 14 of the Constitution- individual hardships cannot justify altering a rule of general application and underscored that the determination of cut-off dates is a matter of policy- making. This function squarely lies within the domain of the rule-making authority, not the judiciary, as courts cannot assume the role of framing or modifying policy decisions in the guise of judicial review.

**Code of Civil Procedure 1908 \- Section 96 \- Order XLI \-** High Court set aside the Trial Court judgment remanding the matter back to the Trial Court for de-novo disposal \- Allowing appeal, SC observed: The appeal could have been very well decided on the basis of the interpretation of the three documents (being the sale deed, the conveyance deed and the settlement deed) since the area of the property as well as the borders and boundaries shown were the same in all the said documents. When the matter could have been decided on the interpretation of the said three documents, again remitting the matter only for the appointment of another Court Commissioner would further delay the proceedings between the parties which have been pending for more than 14 years- In any case, if the learned Single Judge of the High Court was of the view that a Court Commissioner’s report would have assisted in deciding the appeal, the learned Single Judge of the High Court himself could have appointed the Court Commissioner and called for the report.

**Service Law \- Withdrawal of GO** \- G.O. dated 18th May, 2013, is to ensure that the persons with disability appointed through the employment exchange in a particular post should be regularly appointed. Therefore, all of them were appointed on probation. Now, by the subsequent G.O. dated 3rd February 2016, what is conferred on the appellants by the G.O. dated 18th May 2013 cannot be withdrawn. Moreover, many appellants based on the G.O. dated 18th May 2013 changed their position and opted for other employment for securing the benefits under the G.O.

**Maternity Benefit Act \- Section 5 \-** A woman employee having less than two surviving children is entitled to a maximum period of benefit i.e. 26 weeks and for a woman employee having two or more than two surviving children, the benefit is restricted to 12 weeks. Thus, there is no ceiling or cap on the number of children to claim maternity benefit. Only thing is that in case of a woman employee having two or more than two surviving children seeking maternity leave, period of the benefit is reduced: from a maximum period of 26 weeks to a maximum of 12 weeks. (Para 19\)  
**Maternity Benefits** \- Policy of the State to arrest population growth by resorting to various population control measures is certainly a laudable objective. So is the objective of granting maternity benefit to women employees. The object of having two child norm as part of the measures to control population growth in the country and the object of providing maternity benefit to women employees including maternity leave in circumstances such as in the present case are not mutually exclusive. The two must be harmonized in a purposive and rationale manner to achieve the social objective. \[Context: In this case, the appellant has two biological children out of her first wedlock. But that was before entry into her service. Post entry into service and from her subsisting marriage, this is her first child, also the two children out of her first wedlock are not residing with her but with their father, who is having their custody. The State's contention is that Fundamental Rule (FR) 101(a) which is applicable to state government employees of Tamil Nadu, maternity leave is available to women state government employees having less than two surviving children- **SC held** that that appellant shall be granted maternity leave under FR 101(a).

**Constitution of India \- Article 129** \- Supreme Court, being a court of record, is vested with inherent powers to punish contempt-These broad- ranging powers are not merely procedural but are central to preserving the dignity, authority, and effective functioning of the judiciary. In fact, it has been quoted in a catena of decisions that the contempt powers afforded to this Court are integral to maintaining the sanctity of judicial proceedings.The constitutional provision for contempt is not subordinate to Parliamentary Legislation; rather, it represents an intrinsic aspect of the judiciary’s autonomy. As a nation rooted in the Rule of Law and constitutionalism, there is immense faith placed in its judiciary, so much so that orders of this Court carry a binding force equivalent to that of Legislative enactments. (Para 10\) The power to punish for contempt, though wide and constitutionally entrenched, is to be exercised with circumspection in a manner that serves the ends of justice rather than merely penalising the individual. (Para 13\) Public authorities and public servants are duty-bound to act in the furtherance of public interest, with every action aligned to subserve the common good. In adjudicating contempt, the Court must necessarily consider the nature and degree of contempt. To instantiate, while public officials may be engaged in the performance of their duties, if there is even an attempt to exhibit wilful and deliberate disregard for the orders of this Court, such conduct would not merely amount to contempt in the narrow sense defined under Statute. Rather, it has a cascading effect—it fosters a perception that judicial directives can be defied with impunity. This cannot be viewed as routine disobedience but must be recognised as a serious affront to the Rule of Law itself. Such acts are generally classified as grave and offensive instances of contempt, warranting appropriate punishment without any misplaced sympathy or unwarranted magnanimity from the Court- On the contrary, where the Court finds that a breach of its order amounts to technical contempt, absent any intent to wilfully defy or disobey its authority, this Court has evolved the practice of affording an opportunity to purge such contempt. For example, where the breach of the Court’s order stems from an act genuinely intended to serve the larger public interest and undertaken in good faith, the Court may lean towards magnanimity and provide the contemnor(s) with an opportunity to purge the contempt. (Para 15\) The conscious non-disclosure of material facts before this Court during the course of proceedings strikes at the very heart of the justice delivery system. It contaminates the sanctity of judicial proceedings, may cause irreversible prejudice to the opposite parties, and carries the potential to result in erroneous precedents being laid down. (Para 17\)

**Fake encounters** \- Fake encounters are extra-judicial killings and must be subject to strict legal scrutiny- (Para 13\) The use of excessive or unlawful force by public authorities, irrespective of the nature of the offence or the antecedents of the victim, cannot be condoned or legitimised on any pretext. Any derogation from the principles of due process, even in the name of expediency or public safety, erodes the foundation of a democratic and civilised society. \[**Context**: AHRC directed to necessary inquiry into the allegations on fake encounters in the State of Assam independently and expeditiously, in accordance with law\]  
**Constitution of India \- Article 32, 226 \-** Where the alleged cause espoused by a third party in the form of a PIL relates to a specific individual or a closed set of individuals — particularly where the implications of judicial intervention may directly alter or jeopardize the legal position of the victim or their kin — it becomes imperative for the courts to tread with utmost circumspection- The danger of an unintended miscarriage of justice or irreversible prejudice being caused to an invisible and voiceless victim or their family, merely because a well-meaning but distanced individual has approached a Writ Court, cannot be discounted. In such situations, it is not sufficient for the court to proceed solely on the averments of the person advancing the cause before the court. Instead, it becomes obligatory for the court to independently explore mechanisms — institutional or otherwise — that can facilitate direct communication with the victim or their family, thereby enabling them to make an informed choice about participation or redressal through judicial means. (Para 20-21) The invocation of public interest jurisdiction, cannot become a substitute for procedural safeguards and the right of individual victims or their families to be heard. The risk of issuing general directions in the absence of independent assessment is not merely procedural — it strikes at the very heart of the principles of fairness and due process that underpin our judicial system. The jurisprudence developed by this Court over the decades reinforces the position that justice must be individualized where the consequences are personal and irreversible. (Para 24\)

**Note**: No legal aspects discussed in this judgment \- SC upheld HC order directing construction of the verandah in front of Court Room No. 1 in alignment with the design of the pre-existing verandahs in front of Court Room Nos. 2 to 9 is absolutely justified and would not violate the UNESCO guidelines- SC observed: High Court administration is under an obligation to provide appropriate facilities for the lawyers and the litigants who throng the Courts \- if so required, the administration would not be precluded from seeking ex-post facto approval for this minimal protective measure which is considered necessary without admitting any exception.

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482** \- HC dismissed petition seeking quashing of criminal proceedings against accused for offences under Section 120B read with Sections 420, 468, and 471 of the Indian Penal Code – Allowing appeal, SC observed: the present criminal proceedings to continue would serve no meaningful purpose, particularly when the dispute between the parties has already been resolved through a full and final settlement. The settlement between the parties having taken place after the alleged commission of the offence, and there being no continuing public interest we see no justification for allowing the matter to proceed further.

**Bail** \- Considerations for grant of bail and cancellation thereof are entirely different. Bail once granted to the accused should normally not be interfered with/cancelled unless there exist circumstances giving rise to an inference that the bail has been procured by practicing fraud or mis-representation; that the allegations against the accused are so grave that the same have an adverse impact on the society at large and shake the conscience of the Court; that releasing the accused respondents on bail is likely to create a sense of fear and terror amongst the society or that the accused while on bail may abscond or tamper with the prosecution evidence. (Para 13\) \[**Context**: SC cancelled bail granted to accused and observed : on both counts, i.e., (i) the nature and gravity of the offence which is nothing short of an attack on the roots of democracy and (ii) the imminent likelihood of the accused adversely affecting a fair trial, the bail granted to the accused respondents has to be cancelled.

**Permanent Alimony** \- Allowing appeal filed by a wife seeking modification of permanent alimony awarded, SC observed: The respondent-husband’s income, financial disclosures, and past earnings establish that he is in a position to pay a higher amount. The appellant-wife, who has remained unmarried and is living independently, is entitled to a level of maintenance that is reflective of the standard of living she enjoyed during the marriage and which reasonably secures her future. Furthermore, the inflationary cost of living and her continued reliance on maintenance as the sole means of financial support necessitate a reassessment of the amount- opinion, a sum of Rs. 50,000/- per month would be just, fair and reasonable to ensure financial stability for the appellant-wife. This amount shall be subject to an enhancement of 5% every two years. (Para 7-8)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 482 \-** HC refused to quash criminal proceedings against accused \- Allowing appeal, SC observed: Even assuming that the accused appellant retracted from his promise to marry the complainant, it cannot be said that he indulged in sexual intercourse with the de-facto complainant under a false promise of marriage or that the offence was committed by him with the de-facto complainant on the ground that she belonged to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes community- The impugned FIR is nothing but a bundle of lies full of fabricated and malicious unsubstantiated allegations levelled by the complainant. The facts on record clearly establish the vindictive and manipulative tendencies of the complainant and these aspects have a great bearing on the controversy. (Para 30\)

**Legal Notice \-** The essential elements of a legal notice would include: a. It should contain a clear and concise set of facts which convey the information leading to the relevant circumstances. This element is also fulfilled when reference is made to any earlier communications issued between the concerned parties; b. It should convey the intimation of any impending legal obligation or breach committed by any party; c. It should convey the intention of the party issuing the communication to hold the other party liable to appropriate legal action or charge; and d. The communication in toto must be unambiguous and should not mislead or suppress material information. If issued under a Statute, it must comply with the relevant requirements prescribed therein as well. (Para 23\)

**Constitution of India \- Article 226 \-** Land allotment authorities such as UPSIDC possess the inherent right to cancel allotments upon violation of stipulated conditions, this Court has consistently emphasized that judicial intervention in matters concerning land revocation should be circumscribed to ensure adherence to procedural safeguards. (Para 20\)

**Public Trust Doctrine \-** The Doctrine emanates from the ancient principle that certain resources (seashores, rivers and forests) are so intrinsically important to the public that they cannot be subjected to unrestricted private control. Rooted in Roman law and incorporated into English common law, this Doctrine recognizes that the Sovereign holds specific resources as a trustee for present and future generations \-The Doctrine does not impose an absolute prohibition on transferring public trust property, it subjects such alienation to stringent judicial review to ensure legitimate public purpose and adequate safeguards \- When a substantial tract of industrial land is allocated without a comprehensive evaluation, it raises critical questions about adherence to these principles. The Doctrine requires that allocation decisions be preceded by a thorough assessment of public benefits, beneficiary credentials, and safeguards ensuring continued compliance with stated purposes. (Para 29-32) \[**Context**: SC directed State Government of Uttar Pradesh and UPSIDC (i) ensure that any such allotment in the future be made in a transparent, non-discriminatory and fair manner by ensuring that such allotment process fetches maximum revenue and also achieves the larger public interest like industrial development priorities, environmental sustainability, and regional economic objectives; and ii) The Subject Land shall also be allotted strictly in accordance with the procedure as illustrated in direction (i) above.

**Environmental Law** \- Environmental grievances must be raised promptly when alleged violations commence, not after transformative changes have materialized and become entrenched. (Para 19\) \[**Context**: SC set aside High Court’s direction to restore the Subject Property to its original condition as a pond and observed: Though made with laudable intentions, fails to account for the transformed reality and the substantial public benefit derived from the current recreational space. (Para 20)\]

**Public Trust Doctrine \-**The public trust doctrine establishes that certain environmental resources are held in trust by the State for the unimpeded enjoyment of the public and for posterity. Although the doctrine imposes a legal obligation upon governmental authorities to protect these resources for public benefit and ecological sustainability, extending to public lands, parks, forests, water bodies, wetlands, and other areas acquired by the State, its application must necessarily be calibrated according to the factual matrix and contemporary public needs. The doctrine, thus, does not operate in isolation but must be harmonized with the objectives of sustainable development and evolving public welfare priorities. (Para 12\)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 8 \- \[ Section 6 BSA\]** \- Mere absconding by itself does not constitute a guilty mind as even an innocent man may feel panicky and may seek to evade the police when wrongly suspected of being involvement as an instinct of self-preservation. But the act of abscondence is certainly a relevant piece of evidence to be considered along with other evidence and is a conduct under Section 8 of the Evidence Act, 1872, which points to his guilty mind- The needle of suspicion gets strengthened by the act. (Para 10.9.2)

**Indian Evidence Act 1872 \- Section 8 \- \[ Section 23(2) BSA\] \-**when recoveries are made under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, the accused should explain how he came into possession of the incriminating articles.

**Criminal Trial \- Motive \-** Motive is something that is very difficult to prove as it remains hidden in the deep recess of the mind of the person concerned and in the absence of any open declaration by the person concerned himself, the motive has to be inferred from the activities and conduct of the person. (Para 10.11.2) that while proof of motive certainly strengthens the prosecution case based on circumstantial evidence, failure to prove the same cannot be fatal. (Para 10.11.3)

**Law Of Evidence \- Fact and Proof \-**  Law does not require that a fact requires to be proved on absolute terms bereft of all doubts. What law contemplates is that for a fact to be considered proven, it must eliminate any reasonable doubt. Reasonable doubt does not mean any trivial, fanciful or imaginary doubt, but doubt based on reason and common sense growing out of the evidence in the case. A fact is considered proved if the court, after reviewing the evidence, either believes it exists or deems its existence probable enough that a prudent person would act on the assumption that it exists. (Para 10.12) \-**Circumstantial Evidence \-** Where the evidence is circumstantial in nature, the circumstances from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn, should be fully established. In other words, each of the circumstances from which certain inferences are sought to be drawn, is required to be proved in accordance with law, and there cannot be any element of surmise and conjecture, and each of these circumstances so proved must form a complete chain without any break to clearly point to the guilt of the accused person. The court has to examine the cumulative effect of the existence of these circumstances, which would point to the guilt of the accused, though any single circumstance may not in itself be sufficient to prove the offence. Thus, if the combined effect of all these circumstances, each of which has been independently proved, establishes the guilt of the accused, then the conviction based on such circumstances can be sustained. These circumstances so proved must be consistent only with the hypothesis with the guilt of the accused and should exclude every hypothesis except the one sought to be proved. Thus, if upon evaluation of a set of proved circumstances consistent with understandable and socially recognised human behaviour, as a cumulative consequence, a clear and definitive pattern emerges which irresistibly points to the culpability of the accused person, we see no reason why we should not accept such an inferred conclusion to be correct to fasten criminal liability on the accused. On the other hand, if such an inference is sought to be assailed on the ground of any doubt, the doubt must be a reasonable one consistent with human behaviour under the circumstances of the case and not fanciful, abstract speculation or imagination. (Para 10.12.1)

**Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 \- Section 313 \-** Examination of an accused under Section 313 CrPC is an important component of the process of judicial scrutiny of the evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against an accused. At the time of indictment and framing of charges against an accused, the untested evidence marshalled by the investigating authority in the course of the investigation is laid bare before the accused, who would have an idea as to the nature of evidence and case being built up against him by the prosecution. This is to enable the accused to prepare and strategize his defence. He will have all the opportunities to discredit any prosecution witness or question any evidence through the tool of cross examination. He will thereafter have the opportunity to lead his defence evidence if any. It is in this context that the answers given by an accused assume great significance in assessing the evidence by the court- While the accused is not obligated to answer the questions put to him and still can maintain his silence or deny the evidence, yet silence or evasive or wrong answers to the questions put by the court provides a perspective to the court in properly evaluating the incriminating materials which have been brought forth by the prosecution by drawing necessary inference including an adverse one.

**Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 \- Section 48 \-** Alienation of any such property on which a charge is created in favour of the concerned cooperative society by way of declaration is totally beyond the capacity of the owner/member who has declared it as a charged property, until the amount, for which the charge was created along with the interest, is repaid in full. However, even if a part of the amount due is paid then a society may, on an application moved by the member, release from charge such part of the property, as it may deem proper having regard to the outstanding amount (Para 20\) \- **Section 48(e)** of the Act declares void any transaction by a member-loanee against the society, where he/she alienates such immovable property on which a charge is created under declaration. Thus, the primal purpose is to safeguard the interest of the society which advanced the loan. As a corollary, the right to sue or get a declaration qua any alienation made by a loanee rests and is available only to the society in favour of whom the property under a declaration was charged. It would, therefore, not be within the domain of the member- loanee who himself commits a breach to take a stand that the act done by him should be declared void, without the society coming forward before an appropriate forum to set aside such alienation. The law cannot, and does not, reward a person for his/her own wrongs

In the present case, the plaintiff cannot be allowed to benefit from his own wrong and the Court will not be a party to a perpetuation of illegality. (Para 32\)

**Criminal Trial \- Gunshot cases** \-In gunshot cases wherein the nature of death – suicidal, accidental or homicidal – is not ascertainable from direct evidence, multiple factors are taken into account for arriving at a conclusion. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the point of entrance, the size of wound, direction of wound, position of wound, possible distance of gunshot, number of wounds, position of weapon, trajectory of bullet after entering into the human body, position of exit wound (if bullet has exited), direction of exit wound, direction of the bullet after exit, distance travelled by the bullet after exit, nature of final impact on surface (if any) etc. All such factors, to the extent of their applicability to the facts of the case, need to be examined by the Court before arriving at a judicial finding of fact (Para 19)- **Circumstantial Evidence** \- In a case based on circumstantial evidence, facts indicating subsequent conduct are relevant facts under Section 8 of the Evidence Act. Equally, the inconsistencies in the version of the appellant are also relevant. However, the occasion to examine the version/defence of the appellant could have arisen only if the prosecution had succeeded in discharging its primary burden beyond reasonable doubt. (Para 21\) **Evidentiary burden to be discharged by the prosecution and the accused** \- Whereas, the former is expected to discharge its burden beyond reasonable doubt, the latter is only required to prove a defence on the anvil of preponderance of probabilities. If the accused leads defence evidence in the course of a criminal trial, the same ought to be tested as probable or improbable in the facts and circumstances of the case. (Para 22\) **Motive** \- In cases purely based on circumstantial evidence, the absence of motive could raise serious questions and might even render the chain of evidence as doubtful. It is so because the presence of motive does the job of explaining the circumstantial evidence.(Para 23-25)
